# About this Booklet {-}

This booklet is adapted from the [Harvard Gov Prefresher booklet](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/), maintained by [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com). 
It will serve as as the text for the UCSD Math Camp, taught by Bertrand Wilden and Keng-Chi Chang, and we have reordered and adapted it to fit the structure of our course.
For information about the role of this math camp as an introduction to graduate school, you may be interested in ["The Math Prefresher and The Collective Future of Political Science Graduate Training"](https://gking.harvard.edu/prefresher), in PS: Political Science & Politics, by Gary King, Shiro Kuriwaki, and Yon Soo Park.
