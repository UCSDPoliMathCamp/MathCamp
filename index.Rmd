# About this Booklet {-}
The UC San Diego Math camp is held each year in September. The 2021 Math Camp instructors are Keng-Chi Chang and Rachel Schoner. The faculty coordinator is Molly Roberts.

This booklet serves as the text for the Math Camp, available as a webpage updated automatically. It is the product of generations of Math Camp instructors and also built heavily from the [Harvard Gov Prefresher](https://github.com/IQSS/prefresher), maintained by [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com). 

For information about the role of this math camp as an introduction to graduate school, you may be interested in ["The Math Prefresher and The Collective Future of Political Science Graduate Training](https://gking.harvard.edu/prefresher), in PS: Political Science & Politics, by Gary King, Shiro Kuriwaki, and Yon Soo Park.
