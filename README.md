[![build](https://github.com/UCSDPoliMathCamp/MathCamp/actions/workflows/deploy_bookdown.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UCSDPoliMathCamp/MathCamp/actions/workflows/deploy_bookdown.yml)

This booklet is adapted from the [Harvard Gov Prefresher booklet](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/), maintained by [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com). 
It will serve as as the text for the UCSD Math Camp. 
We have reordered and adapted it to fit the structure of our course.
