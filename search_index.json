They are a sample of the very beginning of each math section. We have provided links to the parts of the book you can read if the concepts are new to you. The goal of this “pre”-math camp assignment is not to intimidate you but to set common expectations so you can make the most out of the actual Math Camp. Even if you do not understand some or all of these questions after skimming through the linked sections, your effort will pay off, and you will be better prepared for the math camp. We are also open to adjusting these expectations based on feedback (this class is for you), so please do not hesitate to write to the instructors for feedback.

In statistics and calculus, we want to add a sequence of numbers that can be expressed as a pattern without needing to write down all its components. For example, how would we express the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 without writing a hundred numbers? For this we use the summation operator \\(\\sum\\) and the product operator \\(\\prod\\). Summation: \\[\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{100} x_i = x_1+x_2+x_3+\\cdots+x_{100}\\] The bottom of the \\(\\sum\\) symbol indicates an index (here, \\(i\\)), and its start value \\(1\\). At the top is where the index ends. The notion of “addition” is part of the \\(\\sum\\) symbol. The content to the right of the summation is the meat of what we add. While you can pick your favorite index, start, and end values, the content must also have the index. \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n c x_i = c \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n y_i\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n c = n c\\) Product: \\[\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 x_2 x_3 \\cdots x_n\\] Properties: \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n c x_i = c^n \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i\\) \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=k}^n c x_i = c^{n-k+1} \\prod\\limits_{i=k}^n x_i\\) \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i) =\\) a total mess \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n c = c^n\\) Other Useful Functions Factorials!: \\[x! = x\\cdot (x-1) \\cdot (x-2) \\cdots (1)\\] Modulo: Tells you the remainder when you divide the first number by the second. \\(17 \\mod 3 = 2\\) \\(100 \\ \\% \\ 30 = 10\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{5} i =\\) \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{5} i =\\) \\(14 \\mod 4 =\\) \\(4! =\\) Exercise 1.1 (Operators) Let \\(x_1 = 4, x_2 = 3, x_3 = 7, x_4 = 11, x_5 = 2\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{3} (7)x_i\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{5} 2\\) \\(\\prod\\limits_{i=3}^{5} (2)x_i\\) 1.2 Introduction to Functions A function (in \\({\\bf R}^1\\)) is a mapping, or transformation, that relates members of one set to members of another set. For instance, if you have two sets: set \\(A\\) and set \\(B\\), a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) maps every value \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a) \\in B\\). Functions can be “many-to-one”, where many values or combinations of values from set \\(A\\) produce a single output in set \\(B\\), or they can be “one-to-one”, where each value in set \\(A\\) corresponds to a single value in set \\(B\\). A function by definition has a single function value for each element of its domain. This means, there cannot be “one-to-many” mapping. Dimensionality: \\({\\bf R}^1\\) is the set of all real numbers extending from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) — i.e., the real number line. \\({\\bf R}^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional space, where each of the \\(n\\) axes extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\). \\({\\bf R}^1\\) is a one dimensional line. \\({\\bf R}^2\\) is a two dimensional plane. \\({\\bf R}^3\\) is a three dimensional space. Points in \\({\\bf R}^n\\) are ordered \\(n\\)-tuples (just means an combination of \\(n\\) elements where order matters), where each element of the \\(n\\)-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension. For example: \\({\\bf R}^1\\): (3) \\({\\bf R}^2\\): (-15, 5) \\({\\bf R}^3\\): (86, 4, 0) Examples of mapping notation: Function of one variable: \\(f:{\\bf R}^1\\to{\\bf R}^1\\) \\(f(x)=x+1\\). For each \\(x\\) in \\({\\bf R}^1\\), \\(f(x)\\) assigns the number \\(x+1\\). Function of two variables: \\(f: {\\bf R}^2\\to{\\bf R}^1\\). \\(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\\). For each ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) in \\({\\bf R}^2\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) assigns the number \\(x^2+y^2\\). We often use variable \\(x\\) as input and another \\(y\\) as output, e.g. \\(y=x+1\\) Example 1.1 (Functions) For each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions. For \\(x \\in [0,\\infty]\\), \\(f : x \\rightarrow x^2\\) (this could also be written as \\(f(x) = x^2\\)). For \\(x \\in [-\\infty, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\). Exercise 1.2 (Functions) For each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions. For \\(x \\in [-3, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\). For \\(x \\in [0, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow \\sqrt{x}\\) Some functions are defined only on proper subsets of \\({\\bf R}^n\\). Domain: the set of numbers in \\(X\\) at which \\(f(x)\\) is defined. Range: elements of \\(Y\\) assigned by \\(f(x)\\) to elements of \\(X\\), or \\[f(X)=\\{ y : y=f(x), x\\in X\\}\\] Most often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\bf R}^1\\to{\\bf R}^1\\). Image: same as range, but more often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\bf R}^n\\to{\\bf R}^1\\). Some General Types of Functions Monomials: \\(f(x)=a x^k\\) \\(a\\) is the coefficient. \\(k\\) is the degree. Examples: \\(y=x^2\\), \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3\\) Polynomials: sum of monomials. Examples: \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3+x^2\\), \\(y=3x+5\\) The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its monomial terms. Also, it’s often a good idea to write polynomials with terms in decreasing degree. Exponential Functions: Example: \\(y=2^x\\) 1.3 logs and exponents Relationship of logarithmic and exponential functions: \\[y=\\log_a(x) \\iff a^y=x\\] The log function can be thought of as an inverse for exponential functions. \\(a\\) is referred to as the “base” of the logarithm. Common Bases: The two most common logarithms are base 10 and base \\(e\\). Base 10: \\(\\quad y=\\log_{10}(x) \\iff 10^y=x\\). The base 10 logarithm is often simply written as “\\(\\log(x)\\)” with no base denoted. Base \\(e\\): \\(\\quad y=\\log_e(x) \\iff e^y=x\\). The base \\(e\\) logarithm is referred to as the “natural” logarithm and is written as ``\\(\\ln(x)\\)\". Properties of exponential functions: \\(a^x a^y = a^{x+y}\\) \\(a^{-x} = 1/a^x\\) \\(a^x/a^y = a^{x-y}\\) \\((a^x)^y = a^{x y}\\) \\(a^0 = 1\\) Properties of logarithmic functions (any base): Generally, when statisticians or social scientists write \\(\\log(x)\\) they mean \\(\\log_e(x)\\). In other words: \\(\\log_e(x) \\equiv \\ln(x) \\equiv \\log(x)\\) \\[\\log_a(a^x)=x\\] and \\[a^{\\log_a(x)}=x\\] \\(\\log(x y)=\\log(x)+\\log(y)\\) \\(\\log(x^y)=y\\log(x)\\) \\(\\log(1/x)=\\log(x^{-1})=-\\log(x)\\) \\(\\log(x/y)=\\log(x\\cdot y^{-1})=\\log(x)+\\log(y^{-1})=\\log(x)-\\log(y)\\) \\(\\log(1)=\\log(e^0)=0\\) Change of Base Formula: Use the change of base formula to switch bases as necessary: \\[\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\log_a(x)}{\\log_a(b)}\\] Example: \\[\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}\\] You can use logs to go between sum and product notation. This will be particularly important when you’re learning maximum likelihood estimation. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\log \\bigg(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i \\bigg) &amp;=&amp; \\log(x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3 \\cdots \\cdot x_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\log(x_1) + \\log(x_2) + \\log(x_3) + \\cdots + \\log(x_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\log (x_i) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore, you can see that the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logs. We can write this more generally by adding in a constant, \\(c\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\log \\bigg(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n c x_i\\bigg) &amp;=&amp; \\log(cx_1 \\cdot cx_2 \\cdots cx_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\log(c^n \\cdot x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdots x_n)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\log(c^n) + \\log(x_1) + \\log(x_2) + \\cdots + \\log(x_n)\\\\\\\\ &amp;=&amp; n \\log(c) + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\log (x_i)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Example 1.2 (Logarithmic Functions) Evaluate each of the following logarithms \\(\\log_4(16)\\) \\(\\log_2(16)\\) Simplify the following logarithm. By “simplify”, we actually really mean - use as many of the logarithmic properties as you can. \\(\\log_4(x^3y^5)\\) Exercise 1.3 (Logarithmic Functions) Evaluate each of the following logarithms \\(\\log_\\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{27}{8})\\) Simplify each of the following logarithms. By “simplify”, we actually really mean - use as many of the logarithmic properties as you can. \\(\\log(\\frac{x^9y^5}{z^3})\\) \\(\\ln{\\sqrt{xy}}\\) 1.4 Graphing Functions What can a graph tell you about a function? Is the function increasing or decreasing? Over what part of the domain? How ``fast\" does it increase or decrease? Are there global or local maxima and minima? Where? Are there inflection points? Is the function continuous? Is the function differentiable? Does the function tend to some limit? Other questions related to the substance of the problem at hand. 1.5 Solving for Variables and Finding Roots Sometimes we’re given a function \\(y=f(x)\\) and we want to find how \\(x\\) varies as a function of \\(y\\). Use algebra to move \\(x\\) to the left hand side (LHS) of the equation and so that the right hand side (RHS) is only a function of \\(y\\). Example 1.3 (Solving for Variables) Solve for x: \\(y=3x+2\\) \\(y=e^x\\) Solving for variables is especially important when we want to find the roots of an equation: those values of variables that cause an equation to equal zero. Especially important in finding equilibria and in doing maximum likelihood estimation. Procedure: Given \\(y=f(x)\\), set \\(f(x)=0\\). Solve for \\(x\\). Multiple Roots: \\[f(x)=x^2 - 9 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 0=x^2 - 9 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 9=x^2 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\pm \\sqrt{9}=\\sqrt{x^2} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\pm 3=x\\] Quadratic Formula: For quadratic equations \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\), use the quadratic formula: \\[x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\] Exercise 1.4 (Finding Roots) Solve for x: \\(f(x)=3x+2 = 0\\) \\(f(x)=x^2+3x-4=0\\) \\(f(x)=e^{-x}-10 = 0\\) 1.6 Sets Interior Point: The point \\(\\bf x\\) is an interior point of the set \\(S\\) if \\(\\bf x\\) is in \\(S\\) and if there is some \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball around \\(\\bf x\\) that contains only points in \\(S\\). The interior of \\(S\\) is the collection of all interior points in \\(S\\). The interior can also be defined as the union of all open sets in \\(S\\). If the set \\(S\\) is circular, the interior points are everything inside of the circle, but not on the circle’s rim. Example: The interior of the set \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) is \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2&lt; 4 \\}\\) . Boundary Point: The point \\(\\bf x\\) is a boundary point of the set \\(S\\) if every \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball around \\(\\bf x\\) contains both points that are in \\(S\\) and points that are outside \\(S\\). The boundary is the collection of all boundary points. If the set \\(S\\) is circular, the boundary points are everything on the circle’s rim. Example: The boundary of \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) is \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2 = 4 \\}\\). Open: A set \\(S\\) is open if for each point \\(\\bf x\\) in \\(S\\), there exists an open \\(\\epsilon\\)-ball around \\(\\bf x\\) completely contained in \\(S\\). If the set \\(S\\) is circular and open, the points contained within the set get infinitely close to the circle’s rim, but do not touch it. Example: \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2&lt;4 \\}\\) Closed: A set \\(S\\) is closed if it contains all of its boundary points. Alternatively: A set is closed if its complement is open. If the set \\(S\\) is circular and closed, the set contains all points within the rim as well as the rim itself. Example: \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) Note: a set may be neither open nor closed. Example: \\(\\{ (x,y) : 2 &lt; x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) Complement: The complement of set \\(S\\) is everything outside of \\(S\\). If the set \\(S\\) is circular, the complement of \\(S\\) is everything outside of the circle. Example: The complement of \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2\\le 4 \\}\\) is \\(\\{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2 &gt; 4 \\}\\). Empty: The empty (or null) set is a unique set that has no elements, denoted by {} or \\(\\emptyset\\). The empty set is an example of a set that is open and closed, or a “clopen” set. Examples: The set of squares with 5 sides; the set of countries south of the South Pole.

The first day we will get to know each other and get acquainted with R. We will be working with R throughout this course, and today is the beginning, where you will learn about this program. It can be overwhelming to learn any programming language, but we will spend a lot of time and practice with it. Please work through the following tutorials and exercises. There is a lot of information here, and it will take time to understand everything. In fact, programming is a continual learning experience. Please come to class with areas of confusion and questions; we will walk through more examples together. You should downloaded R and R Studio. This video has a nice brief introduction. R Studio Cloud has great resources we will be using throughout this course. Please complete the following primer tutorial for the first session: The Basics: Programming Basics Motivation: Data and You The modal social science project starts by importing existing datasets. Datasets come in all shapes and sizes. As you search for new data you may encounter dozens of file extensions – csv, xlsx, dta, sav, por, Rdata, Rds, txt, xml, json, shp … the list continues. Although these files can often be cumbersome, its a good to be able to find a way to encounter any file that your research may call for. Reviewing data import will allow us to get on the same page on how computer systems work. Where are we starting? Today we’ll cover: What’s what in RStudio What R is, at a high level How to read in data Comment on coding style on the way Check your understanding What is the difference between a file and a folder? In the RStudio windows, what is the difference between the “Source” Pane and the “Console”? What is a “code chunk”? How do you read a R help page? What is the Usage section, the Values section, and the Examples section? What use is the “Environment” Pane? How would you read in a spreadsheet in R? How would you figure out what variables are in the data? size of the data? How would you read in a csv file, a dta file, a sav file? 2.1 Orienting RStudio is a GUI and an IDE for the programming language R. A Graphical User Interface allows users to interface with the software (in this case R) using graphical aids like buttons and tabs. Often we don’t think of GUIs because to most computer users, everything is a GUI (like Microsoft Word or your “Control Panel”), but it’s always there! A Integrated Development Environment just says that the software to interface with R comes with useful useful bells and whistles to give you shortcuts. The Console is kind of a the core window through which you see your GUI actually operating through R. It’s not graphical so might not be as intuitive. But all your results, commands, errors, warnings.. you see them in here. A console tells you what’s going on now. via the GUI, you the analyst needs to sends instructions, or commands, to the R application. The verb for this is “run” or “execute” the command. Computer programs ask users to provide instructions in very specific formats. While a English-speaking human can understand a sentence with a few typos in it by filling in the blanks, the same typo or misplaced character would halt a computer program. Each program has its own requirements for how commands should be typed; after all, each of these is its own language. We refer to the way a program needs its commands to be formatted as its syntax. Theoretically, one could do all their work by typing in commands into the Console. But that would be a lot of work, because you’d have to give instructions each time you start your data analysis. Moreover, you’ll have no record of what you did. That’s why you need a script. This is a type of code. It can be referred to as a source because that is the source of your commands. Source is also used as a verb; “source the script” just means execute it. RStudio doesn’t start out with a script, so you can make one from “File &gt; New” or the New file icon. You can also open scripts that are in folders in your computer. A script is a type of File. Find your Files in the bottom-right “Files” pane. To load a dataset, you need to specify where that file is. Computer files (data, documents, programs) are organized hiearchically, like a branching tree. Folders can contain files, and also other folders. The GUI toolbar makes this lineaer and hiearchical relationship apparent. When we turn to locate the file in our commands, we need another set of syntax. Importantly, denote the hierarchy of a folder by the / (slash) symbol. data/input/2018-08 indicates the 2018-08 folder, which is included in the input folder, which is in turn included in the data folder. Files (but not folders) have “file extensions” which you are probably familiar with already: .docx, .pdf, and .pdf. The file extensions you will see in a stats or quantitative social science class are: .pdf: PDF, a convenient format to view documents and slides in, regardless of Mac/Windows. .csv: A comma separated values file .xlsx: Microsoft Excel file .dta: Stata data .sav: SPSS data .R: R code (script) .Rmd: Rmarkdown code (text + code) .do: Stata code (script) In R, there are two main types of scripts. A classic .R file and a .Rmd file (for Rmarkdown). A .R file is just lines and lines of R code that is meant to be inserted right into the Console. A .Rmd tries to weave code and English together, to make it easier for users to create reports that interact with data and intersperse R code with explanation. For example, we built this book in Rmds. The Rmarkdown facilitates is the use of __code chunks__, which are used here. These start and end with three back-ticks. In the beginning, we can add options in curly braces (`{}`). Specifying `r` in the beginning tells to render it as R code. Options like `echo = TRUE` switch between showing the code that was executed or not; `eval = TRUE` switch between evaluating the code. More about Rmarkdown in Section \\@ref(nonwysiwyg). For example, this code chunk would evaluate `1 + 1` and show its output when compiled, but not display the code that was executed. A code chunk in Rmarkdown (before rendering) 2.2 But what is R? R is an object oriented programming language primarily used for statistical computing. An object oriented language is a programming language built around manipulating objects. In R, objects can be matrices, vectors, scalars, strings, and data frames, for example Objects contain different types of information Different objects have different allowable procedures: # Adding a string and a string does not work because the &#39;+&#39; operator # does not work for strings: # &#39;UCSD&#39; + &#39;PoliSci&#39; # The &#39;+&#39; operator can add numbers just fine 9 + 13 ## [1] 22 # Reminder: to figure out the type of an object use: x &lt;- 9 class(9) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(&#39;UCSD&#39;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Object oriented programming makes languages flexible and powerful: You can create custom functions and objects for your needs Other people can create great packages for everyone to use Many errors come from using the wrong data type and a lot of programming in R is getting data into the right format and type to work with. It is helpful to think in terms of object manipulation at a high level while programming in R, particularly at the beginning of tackling a new problem. Think about what objects you want to manipulate, what types they are, and how they fit together. Once you have the logic of your solution ready then you can write it in R. 2.3 Base-R vs. tidyverse One last thing before we jump into data. Many things in R and other open source packages have competing standards. A lecture on a technique inevitably biases one standard over another. Right now among R users in this area, there are two families of functions: base-R and tidyverse. R instructors thus face a dilemma about which to teach primarily.1 In this math camp, we try our best to choose the one that is most useful to the modal task of social science researchers, and make use of the tidyverse functions in most applications. However, feel free to suggest changes to us or to the booklet. Although you do not need to choose one over the other, for beginners it is confusing what is a tidyverse function and what is not. Many of the tidyverse packages are covered in this 2017 graphic below, and the cheat-sheets that other programmers have written: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ Names of Packages in the tidyverse Family The following side-by-side comparison of commands for a particular function compares some tidyverse and non-tidyverse functions (which we refer to loosely as base-R). This list is not meant to be comprehensive and more to give you a quick rule of thumb. Dataframe subsetting In order to … in tidyverse: in base-R: Count each category count(df, var) table(df$var) Filter rows by condition filter(df, var == \"Female\") df[df$var == \"Female\", ] or subset(df, var == \"Female\") Extract columns select(df, var1, var2) df[, c(\"var1\", \"var2\")] Extract a single column as a vector pull(df, var) df[[\"var\"]] or df[, \"var\"] Combine rows bind_rows() rbind() Combine columns bind_cols() cbind() Create a dataframe tibble(x = vec1, y = vec2) data.frame(x = vec1, y = vec2) Turn a dataframe into a tidyverse dataframe tbl_df(df) Remember that tidyverse applies to dataframes only, not vectors. For subsetting vectors, use the base-R functions with the square brackets. Read data Some non-tidyverse functions are not quite “base-R” but have similar relationships to tidyverse. For these, we recommend using the tidyverse functions as a general rule due to their common format, simplicity, and scalability. In order to … in tidyverse: in base-R: Read a Excel file read_excel() read.xlsx() Read a csv read_csv() read.csv() Read a Stata file read_dta() read.dta() Substitute strings str_replace() gsub() Return matching strings str_subset() grep(., value = TRUE) Merge data1 and data2 on variables x1 and x2 left_join(data1, data2, by = c(\"x1\", \"x2\")) merge(data1, data2, by.x = \"x1\", by.y = \"x2\", all.x = TRUE) Visualization Plotting by ggplot2 (from your tutorials) is also a tidyverse family. In order to … in tidyverse: in base-R: Make a scatter plot ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() plot(data$x, data$y) Make a line plot ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() plot(data$x, data$y, type = \"l\") Make a histogram ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_histogram() hist(data$x, data$y) Make a barplot See Section 4 See Section 4 2.4 A is for Athens For our first dataset, let’s try reading in a dataset on the Ancient Greek world. Political Theorists and Political Historians study the domestic systems, international wars, cultures and writing of this era to understand the first instance of democracy, the rise and overturning of tyranny, and the legacies of political institutions. This POLIS dataset was generously provided by Professor Josiah Ober of Stanford University. This dataset includes information on city states in the Ancient Greek world, parts of it collected by careful work by historians and archaeologists. It is part of his recent books on Greece (Ober 2015), “The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece”2 and Institutions in Ancient Athens (Ober 2010) , “Democracy and Knowledge: Innovation and Learning in Classical Athens.”3 2.4.1 Locating the Data What files do we have in the data/input folder? ## data/input/Nunn_Wantchekon_AER_2011.dta data/input/Nunn_Wantchekon_sample.dta ## data/input/acs2015_1percent.csv data/input/gapminder_wide.Rds ## data/input/gapminder_wide.tab data/input/german_credit.sav ## data/input/justices_court-median.csv data/input/ober_2018.xlsx ## data/input/sample_mid.csv data/input/sample_polity.csv ## data/input/upshot-siena-polls.csv data/input/usc2010_001percent.Rds ## data/input/usc2010_001percent.csv A typical file format is Microsoft Excel. Although this is not usually the best format for R because of its highly formatted structure as opposed to plain text (more on this in Section (sec:nonwysiwyg)), recent packages have made this fairly easy. 2.4.2 Reading in Data In Rstudio, a good way to start is to use the GUI and the Import tool. Once you click a file, an option to “Import Dataset” comes up. RStudio picks the right function for you, and you can copy that code, but it’s important to eventually be able to write that code yourself. For the first time using an outside package, you first need to install it. install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;) After that, you don’t need to install it again. But you do need to load it each time. library(readxl) The package readxl has a website: https://readxl.tidyverse.org/. Other packages are not as user-friendly, but they have a help page with a table of contents of all their functions. help(package = readxl) From the help page, we see that read_excel() is the function that we want to use. Let’s try it. library(readxl) ober &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/input/ober_2018.xlsx&quot;) Review: what does the / mean? Why do we need the data term first? Does the argument need to be in quotes? 2.4.3 Inspecting For almost any dataset, you usually want to do a couple of standard checks first to understand what you loaded. ober ## # A tibble: 1,035 × 10 ## polis_number Name Latit…¹ Longi…² Helle…³ Fame Size Colon…⁴ Regime Delian ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Alalie 42.1 9.51 most G… 1.12 100-… 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## 2 2 Empor… 42.1 3.11 most b… 2.12 25-1… 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## 3 3 Massa… 43.3 5.38 most G… 4 25-1… 2 no ev… not i… ## 4 4 Rhode 42.3 3.17 most G… 0.87 &lt;NA&gt; 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## 5 5 Abaka… 38.1 15.1 most b… 1 &lt;NA&gt; 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## 6 6 Adran… 37.7 14.8 most G… 1 &lt;NA&gt; 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## 7 7 Agyri… 37.7 14.5 most G… 1.25 &lt;NA&gt; 0 no ev… not i… ## 8 8 Aitna 38.2 15.6 most G… 3.25 200-… 1 no ev… not i… ## 9 9 Akrag… 37.3 13.6 most G… 6.37 500 … 0 evide… not i… ## 10 10 Akrai 37.1 14.9 most G… 1.25 &lt;NA&gt; 0 &lt;NA&gt; not i… ## # … with 1,025 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Latitude, ²​Longitude, ## # ³​Hellenicity, ⁴​Colonies ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows dim(ober) ## [1] 1035 10 From your tutorials, you also know how to do graphics! Graphics are useful for grasping your data, but we will cover them more deeply in Chapter 4. ggplot(ober, aes(x = Fame)) + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. What about the distribution of fame by regime? ggplot(ober, aes(y = Fame, x = Regime, group = Regime)) + geom_boxplot() What do the 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s stand for? 2.4.4 Finding observations These tidyverse commands from the dplyr package are newer and not built-in, but they are one of the increasingly more popular ways to wrangle data. 80 percent of your data wrangling needs might be doable with these basic dplyr functions: select, mutate, group_by, summarize, and arrange. These verbs roughly correspond to the same commands in SQL, another important language in data science. The %&gt;% symbol is a pipe. It takes the thing on the left side and pipes it down to the function on the right side. We could have done count(cen10, race) as cen10 %&gt;% count(race). That means take cen10 and pass it on to the function count, which will count observations by race and return a collapsed dataset with the categories in its own variable and their respective counts in n. See for example this community discussion: https://community.rstudio.com/t/base-r-and-the-tidyverse/2965/17↩︎ Ober, Josiah (2015). The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece.

Up till now, you should have covered: R basic programming Data Import Today we’ll cover Objects Functions Loops 3.1 What is an object? Now that we have covered how to load in data and some basic information about R, let’s dive into some fundamentals of the R language. Let’s first set up library(dplyr) library(readr) library(haven) library(ggplot2) cen10 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/input/usc2010_001percent.csv&quot;, col_types = cols()) Objects are abstract symbols in which you store data. Here we will create an object from copy, and assign cen10 to it. copy &lt;- cen10 This looks the same as the original dataset: copy ## # A tibble: 30,871 × 4 ## state sex age race ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 New York Female 8 White ## 2 Ohio Male 24 White ## 3 Nevada Male 37 White ## 4 Michigan Female 12 White ## 5 Maryland Female 18 Black/Negro ## 6 New Hampshire Male 50 White ## 7 Iowa Female 51 White ## 8 Missouri Female 41 White ## 9 New Jersey Male 62 White ## 10 California Male 25 White ## # … with 30,861 more rows ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows What happens if you do this next? copy &lt;- &quot;&quot; It got reassigned: copy ## [1] &quot;&quot; 3.1.1 lists Lists are one of the most generic and flexible type of object. You can make an empty list by the function list() my_list &lt;- list() my_list ## list() And start filling it in. Slots on the list are invoked by double square brackets [[]] my_list[[1]] &lt;- &quot;contents of the first slot -- this is a string&quot; my_list[[&quot;slot 2&quot;]] &lt;- &quot;contents of slot named slot 2&quot; my_list ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;contents of the first slot -- this is a string&quot; ## ## $`slot 2` ## [1] &quot;contents of slot named slot 2&quot; each slot can be anything. What are we doing here? We are defining the 1st slot of the list my_list to be a vector c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) my_list[[1]] &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) my_list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $`slot 2` ## [1] &quot;contents of slot named slot 2&quot; You can even make nested lists. Let’s say we want the 1st slot of the list to be another list of three elements. my_list[[1]][[1]] &lt;- &quot;subitem 1 in slot 1 of my_list&quot; my_list[[1]][[2]] &lt;- &quot;subitem 1 in slot 2 of my_list&quot; my_list[[1]][[3]] &lt;- &quot;subitem 1 in slot 3 of my_list&quot; my_list ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;subitem 1 in slot 1 of my_list&quot; &quot;subitem 1 in slot 2 of my_list&quot; ## [3] &quot;subitem 1 in slot 3 of my_list&quot; &quot;4&quot; ## [5] &quot;5&quot; ## ## $`slot 2` ## [1] &quot;contents of slot named slot 2&quot; 3.2 Making your own objects We’ve covered one type of object, which is a list. You saw it was quite flexible. How many types of objects are there? There are an infinite number of objects, because people make their own class of object. You can detect the type of the object (the class) by the function class Object can be said to be an instance of a class. Analogies: class - Pokemon, object - Pikachu class - Book, object - To Kill a Mockingbird class - DataFrame, object - 2010 census data class - Character, object - “Programming is Fun” What is type (class) of object is cen10? class(cen10) ## [1] &quot;spec_tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; What about this text? class(&quot;some random text&quot;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; To change or create the class of any object, you can assign it. To do this, assign the name of your class to character to an object’s class(). We can start from a simple list. For example, say we wanted to store data about pokemon. Because there is no pre-made package for this, we decide to make our own class. pikachu &lt;- list(name = &quot;Pikachu&quot;, number = 25, type = &quot;Electric&quot;, color = &quot;Yellow&quot;) and we can give it any class name we want. class(pikachu) &lt;- &quot;Pokemon&quot; str(pikachu) ## List of 4 ## $ name : chr &quot;Pikachu&quot; ## $ number: num 25 ## $ type : chr &quot;Electric&quot; ## $ color : chr &quot;Yellow&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;Pokemon&quot; pikachu$type ## [1] &quot;Electric&quot; 3.2.1 Seeing R through objects Most of the R objects that you will see as you advance are their own objects. For example, here’s a linear regression object (which you will learn more about in 204B): ols &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt + vs + gear + carb, mtcars) class(ols) ## [1] &quot;lm&quot; Anything can be an object! Even graphs (in ggplot) can be assigned, re-assigned, and edited. grp_race &lt;- group_by(cen10, race)%&gt;% summarize(count = n()) grp_race_ordered &lt;- arrange(grp_race, count) %&gt;% mutate(race = forcats::as_factor(race)) gg_tab &lt;- ggplot(data = grp_race_ordered) + aes(x = race, y = count) + geom_col() + labs(caption = &quot;Source: U.S. Census 2010&quot;) gg_tab You can change the orientation gg_tab&lt;- gg_tab + coord_flip() 3.2.2 Parsing an object by str()s It can be hard to understand an R object because its contents are unknown. The function str, short for structure, is a quick way to look into the innards of an object str(my_list) ## List of 2 ## $ : chr [1:5] &quot;subitem 1 in slot 1 of my_list&quot; &quot;subitem 1 in slot 2 of my_list&quot; &quot;subitem 1 in slot 3 of my_list&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## $ slot 2: chr &quot;contents of slot named slot 2&quot; class(my_list) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; Same for the object we just made str(pikachu) ## List of 4 ## $ name : chr &quot;Pikachu&quot; ## $ number: num 25 ## $ type : chr &quot;Electric&quot; ## $ color : chr &quot;Yellow&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;Pokemon&quot; What does a ggplot object look like? Very complicated, but at least you can see it: # enter this on your console str(gg_tab) 3.3 Types of variables In the social science we often analyze variables. As you saw in the tutorial, different types of variables require different care. A key link with what we just learned is that variables are also types of R objects. 3.3.1 scalars One number. How many people did we count in our Census sample? nrow(cen10) ## [1] 30871 Question: What proportion of our census sample is Native American? This number is also a scalar # Enter yourself unique(cen10$race) ## [1] &quot;White&quot; &quot;Black/Negro&quot; ## [3] &quot;Other race, nec&quot; &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot; ## [5] &quot;Chinese&quot; &quot;Other Asian or Pacific Islander&quot; ## [7] &quot;Two major races&quot; &quot;Three or more major races&quot; ## [9] &quot;Japanese&quot; mean(cen10$race == &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot;) ## [1] 0.009555894 Hint: you can use the function mean() to calcualte the sample mean. The sample proportion is the mean of a sequence of number, where your event of interest is a 1 (or TRUE) and others are 0 (or FALSE). 3.3.2 numeric vectors A sequence of numbers. grp_race_ordered$count ## [1] 77 88 295 354 869 1129 1839 4013 22207 class(grp_race_ordered$count) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Or even, all the ages of the millions of people in our Census. Here are just the first few numbers of the list. head(cen10$age) ## [1] 8 24 37 12 18 50 3.3.3 characters (aka strings) This can be just one stretch of characters my_name &lt;- &quot;Meg&quot; my_name ## [1] &quot;Meg&quot; class(my_name) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; or more characters. Notice here that there’s a difference between a vector of individual characters and a length-one object of characters. my_name_letters &lt;- c(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) my_name_letters ## [1] &quot;M&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;g&quot; class(my_name_letters) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Finally, remember that lower vs. upper case matters in R! my_name2 &lt;- &quot;shiro&quot; my_name == my_name2 ## [1] FALSE 3.4 What is a function? Most of what we do in R is executing a function. read_csv(), nrow(), ggplot() .. pretty much anything with a parentheses is a function. And even things like &lt;- and [ are functions as well. A function is a set of instructions with specified ingredients. It takes an input, then manipulates it – changes it in some way – and then returns the manipulated product. One way to see what a function actually does is to enter it without parentheses. # enter this on your console table You’ll see below that the most basic functions are quite complicated internally. You’ll notice that functions contain other functions. wrapper functions are functions that “wrap around” existing functions. This sounds redundant, but it’s an important feature of programming. If you find yourself repeating a command more than two times, you should make your own function, rather than writing the same type of code. 3.4.1 Write your own function It’s worth remembering the basic structure of a function. You create a new function, call it my_fun by this: my_fun &lt;- function() { } If we wanted to generate a function that computed the number of men in your data, what would that look like? count_men &lt;- function(data) { nmen &lt;- sum(data$sex == &quot;Male&quot;) return(nmen) } Then all we need to do is feed this function a dataset count_men(cen10) ## [1] 15220 The point of a function is that you can use it again and again without typing up the set of constituent manipulations. So, what if we wanted to figure out the number of men in California? count_men(cen10[cen10$state == &quot;California&quot;,]) ## [1] 1876 Let’s go one step further. What if we want to know the proportion of non-whites in a state, just by entering the name of the state? There’s multiple ways to do it, but it could look something like this nw_in_state &lt;- function(data, state) { s.subset &lt;- data[data$state == state,] total.s &lt;- nrow(s.subset) nw.s &lt;- sum(s.subset$race != &quot;White&quot;) nw.s / total.s } The last line is what gets generated from the function. To be more explicit you can wrap the last line around return(). (as in return(nw.s/total.s). return() is used when you want to break out of a function in the middle of it and not wait till the last line. Try it on your favorite state! nw_in_state(cen10, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;) ## [1] 0.2040185 Checkpoint 1 Try making your own function, average_age_in_state, that will give you the average age of people in a given state. # Enter on your own 2 Try making your own function, asians_in_state, that will give you the number of Chinese, Japanese, and Other Asian or Pacific Islander people in a given state. # Enter on your own 3 Try making your own function, ‘top_10_oldest_cities’, that will give you the names of cities whose population’s average age is top 10 oldest. # Enter on your own 3.5 What is a package? You can think of a package as a suite of functions that other people have already built for you to make your life easier. help(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) To use a package, you need to do two things: (1) install it, and then (2) load it. Installing is a one-time thing install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) But you need to load each time you start a R instance. So always keep these commands on a script. library(ggplot2) In rstudio.cloud, we already installed a set of packages for you. But when you start your own R instance, you need to have installed the package at some point. 3.6 Conditionals Sometimes, you want to execute a command only under certain conditions. This is done through the almost universal function, if(). Inside the if function we enter a logical statement. The line that is adjacent to, or follows, the if() statement only gets executed if the statement returns TRUE. For example, For example, x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt;0) { print(&quot;positive number&quot;) } else if (x == 0) { print (&quot;zero&quot;) } else { print(&quot;negative number&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;positive number&quot; You can wrap that whole things in a function is_positive &lt;- function(number) { if (number &gt;0) { print(&quot;positive number&quot;) } else if (number == 0) { print (&quot;zero&quot;) } else { print(&quot;negative number&quot;) } } is_positive(5) ## [1] &quot;positive number&quot; is_positive(-3) ## [1] &quot;negative number&quot; 3.7 For-loops Loops repeat the same statement, although the statement can be “the same” only in an abstract sense. Use the for(x in X) syntax to repeat the subsequent command as many times as there are elements in the right-hand object X. Each of these elements will be referred to the left-hand index x First, come up with a vector. fruits &lt;- c(&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;) Now we use the fruits vector in a for loop. for (fruit in fruits) { print(paste(&quot;I love&quot;, fruit)) } ## [1] &quot;I love apples&quot; ## [1] &quot;I love oranges&quot; ## [1] &quot;I love grapes&quot; Here for() and in must be part of any for loop. The right hand side fruits must be a thing that exists. Finally the left-hand side object is “Pick your favor name.” It is analogous to how we can index a sum with any letter. \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{10}i\\) and sum_{j = 1}^{10}j are in fact the same thing. for (i in 1:length(fruits)) { print(paste(&quot;I love&quot;, fruits[i])) } ## [1] &quot;I love apples&quot; ## [1] &quot;I love oranges&quot; ## [1] &quot;I love grapes&quot; states_of_interest &lt;- c(&quot;California&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) for( state in states_of_interest){ state_data &lt;- cen10[cen10$state == state,] nmen &lt;- sum(state_data$sex == &quot;Male&quot;) n &lt;- nrow(state_data) men_perc &lt;- round(100*(nmen/n), digits=2) print(paste(&quot;Percentage of men in&quot;,state, &quot;is&quot;, men_perc)) } ## [1] &quot;Percentage of men in California is 49.85&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of men in Massachusetts is 47.6&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of men in New Hampshire is 48.55&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of men in Washington is 48.19&quot; Instead of printing, you can store the information in a vector states_of_interest &lt;- c(&quot;California&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) male_percentages &lt;- c() iter &lt;-1 for( state in states_of_interest){ state_data &lt;- cen10[cen10$state == state,] nmen &lt;- sum(state_data$sex == &quot;Male&quot;) n &lt;- nrow(state_data) men_perc &lt;- round(100*(nmen/n), digits=2) male_percentages &lt;- c(male_percentages, men_perc) names(male_percentages)[iter] &lt;- state iter &lt;- iter + 1 } male_percentages ## California Massachusetts New Hampshire Washington ## 49.85 47.60 48.55 48.19 3.8 Nested Loops What if I want to calculate the population percentage of a race group for all race groups in states of interest?

Ideally, it would be a function that helps you do either of the previous tasks in fewer lines of code. You can use the three lines of code that was provided in exercise 1 to wrap that into another function too! # Enter yourself Exercise 2: Using Loops Using a loop, create a crosstab of sex and race for each state in the set “states_of_interest” states_of_interest &lt;- c(&quot;California&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) # Enter yourself Exercise 3: Storing information derived within loops in a global dataframe Recall the following nested loop states_of_interest &lt;- c(&quot;California&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;) for (state in states_of_interest) { for (race in unique(cen10$race)) { race_state_num &lt;- nrow(cen10[cen10$race == race &amp; cen10$state == state, ]) state_pop &lt;- nrow(cen10[cen10$state == state, ]) race_perc &lt;- round(100*(race_state_num/(state_pop)), digits=2) print(paste(&quot;Percentage of &quot;, race , &quot;in&quot;, state, &quot;is&quot;, race_perc)) } } ## [1] &quot;Percentage of White in California is 57.61&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Black/Negro in California is 6.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other race, nec in California is 15.55&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of American Indian or Alaska Native in California is 1.12&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Chinese in California is 3.75&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other Asian or Pacific Islander in California is 9.54&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Two major races in California is 4.62&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Three or more major races in California is 0.37&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Japanese in California is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of White in Massachusetts is 79.6&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Black/Negro in Massachusetts is 5.87&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other race, nec in Massachusetts is 4.02&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of American Indian or Alaska Native in Massachusetts is 0.77&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Chinese in Massachusetts is 2.32&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other Asian or Pacific Islander in Massachusetts is 4.33&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Two major races in Massachusetts is 2.78&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Three or more major races in Massachusetts is 0&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Japanese in Massachusetts is 0.31&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of White in New Hampshire is 93.48&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Black/Negro in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other race, nec in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of American Indian or Alaska Native in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Chinese in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other Asian or Pacific Islander in New Hampshire is 2.17&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Two major races in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Three or more major races in New Hampshire is 0&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Japanese in New Hampshire is 0.72&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of White in Washington is 76.05&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Black/Negro in Washington is 2.9&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other race, nec in Washington is 5.37&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of American Indian or Alaska Native in Washington is 2.03&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Chinese in Washington is 1.31&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Other Asian or Pacific Islander in Washington is 6.68&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Two major races in Washington is 4.79&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Three or more major races in Washington is 0.29&quot; ## [1] &quot;Percentage of Japanese in Washington is 0.58&quot; Instead of printing the percentage of each race in each state, create a dataframe, and store all that information in that dataframe.

Then, we’ll do an example on time trends with Supreme Court ideal points. Why care about the Census? The Census is one of the fundamental acts of a government. See the Law Review article by Persily (2011), “The Law of the Census.”4 The Census is government’s primary tool for apportionment (allocating seats to districts), appropriations (allocating federal funding), and tracking demographic change. See for example Hochschild and Powell (2008) on how the categorizations of race in the Census during 1850-1930.5 Notice also that both of these pieces are not inherently “quantitative” — the Persily article is a Law Review and the Hochschild and Powell article is on American Historical Development — but data analysis would be certainly relevant. Time series data is a common form of data in social science data, and there is growing methodological work on making causal inferences with time series.6 We will use the the ideological estimates of the Supreme court. Where are we? Where are we headed? Up till now, you should have covered: The R Visualization and Programming primers at https://rstudio.cloud/primers/ Reading and handling data Matrices and Vectors What does : mean in R? What about ==? ,?, != , &amp;, |, %in% What does %&gt;% do? Today we’ll cover: Visualization A bit of data wrangling Check your understanding How do you make a barplot, in base-R and in ggplot? How do you add layers to a ggplot? How do you change the axes of a ggplot? How do you make a histogram? How do you make a graph that looks like this? By Randy Schutt - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia. 4.1 Read data First, the census. Read in a subset of the 2010 Census that we looked at earlier. This time, it is in Rds form. cen10 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/input/usc2010_001percent.Rds&quot;) The data comes from IPUMS7, a great source to extract and analyze Census and Census-conducted survey (ACS, CPS) data. 4.2 Counting How many people are in your sample? nrow(cen10) ## [1] 30871 This and all subsequent tasks involve manipulating and summarizing data, sometimes called “wrangling”. As per last time, there are both “base-R” and “tidyverse” approaches. We have already seen several functions from the tidyverse: select selects columns filter selects rows based on a logical (boolean) statement slice selects rows based on the row number arrange reordered the rows in descending order. In this visualization section, we’ll make use of the pair of functions group_by() and summarize(). 4.3 Tabulating Summarizing data is the key part of communication; good data viz gets the point across.8 Summaries of data come in two forms: tables and figures. Here are two ways to count by group, or to tabulate. In base-R Use the table function, that provides how many rows exist for an unique value of the vector (remember unique from yesterday?) table(cen10$race) ## ## American Indian or Alaska Native Black/Negro ## 295 4013 ## Chinese Japanese ## 354 77 ## Other Asian or Pacific Islander Other race, nec ## 1129 1839 ## Three or more major races Two major races ## 88 869 ## White ## 22207 With tidyverse, a quick convenience function is count, with the variable to count on included. count(cen10, race) ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## race n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 American Indian or Alaska Native 295 ## 2 Black/Negro 4013 ## 3 Chinese 354 ## 4 Japanese 77 ## 5 Other Asian or Pacific Islander 1129 ## 6 Other race, nec 1839 ## 7 Three or more major races 88 ## 8 Two major races 869 ## 9 White 22207 We can check out the arguments of count and see that there is a sort option. What does this do? count(cen10, race, sort = TRUE) ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## race n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 White 22207 ## 2 Black/Negro 4013 ## 3 Other race, nec 1839 ## 4 Other Asian or Pacific Islander 1129 ## 5 Two major races 869 ## 6 Chinese 354 ## 7 American Indian or Alaska Native 295 ## 8 Three or more major races 88 ## 9 Japanese 77 count is a kind of shorthand for group_by() and summarize. This code would have done the same. cen10 %&gt;% group_by(race) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) ## # A tibble: 9 × 2 ## race n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 American Indian or Alaska Native 295 ## 2 Black/Negro 4013 ## 3 Chinese 354 ## 4 Japanese 77 ## 5 Other Asian or Pacific Islander 1129 ## 6 Other race, nec 1839 ## 7 Three or more major races 88 ## 8 Two major races 869 ## 9 White 22207 If you are new to tidyverse, what would you think each row did? Reading the function help page, verify if your intuition was correct. where n() is a function that counts rows. 4.4 base R graphics and ggplot Two prevalent ways of making graphing are referred to as “base-R” and “ggplot”. 4.4.1 base R “Base-R” graphics are graphics that are made with R’s default graphics commands. First, let’s assign our tabulation to an object, then put it in the barplot() function. barplot(table(cen10$race)) 4.4.2 ggplot A popular alternative a ggplot graphics, that you were introduced to in the tutorial. gg stands for grammar of graphics by Hadley Wickham, and it has a new semantics of explaining graphics in R. Again, first let’s set up the data. Although the tutorial covered making scatter plots as the first cut, often data requires summaries before they made into graphs. For this example, let’s group and count first like we just did. But assign it to a new object. grp_race &lt;- count(cen10, race) We will now plot this grouped set of numbers. Recall that the ggplot() function takes two main arguments, data and aes. First enter a single dataframe from which you will draw a plot. Then enter the aes, or aesthetics. This defines which variable in the data the plotting functions should take for pre-set dimensions in graphics. The dimensions x and y are the most important. We will assign race and count to them, respectively, After you close ggplot() .. add layers by the plus sign. A geom is a layer of graphical representation, for example geom_histogram renders a histogram, geom_point renders a scatter plot. For a barplot, we can use geom_col() What is the right geometry layer to make a barplot? Turns out: ggplot(data = grp_race, aes(x = race, y = n)) + geom_col() 4.5 Improving your graphics Adjusting your graphics to make the point clear is an important skill. Here is a base-R example of showing the same numbers but with a different design, in a way that aims to maximize the “data-to-ink ratio”. par(oma = c(1, 11, 1, 1)) barplot(sort(table(cen10$race)), # sort numbers horiz = TRUE, # flip border = NA, # border is extraneous xlab = &quot;Number in Race Category&quot;, bty = &quot;n&quot;, # no box las = 1) # alignment of axis labels is horizontal Notice that we applied the sort() function to order the bars in terms of their counts. The default ordering of a categorical variable / factor is alphabetical. Alphabetical ordering is uninformative and almost never the way you should order variables. In ggplot you might do this by: library(forcats) grp_race_ordered &lt;- arrange(grp_race, n) %&gt;% mutate(race = as_factor(race)) ggplot(data = grp_race_ordered, aes(x = race, y = n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + labs(y = &quot;Number in Race Category&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: 2010 U.S. Census sample&quot;) The data ink ratio was popularized by Ed Tufte (originally a political economy scholar who has recently become well known for his data visualization work). See Tufte (2001), The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and his website https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/. For a R and ggplot focused example using social science examples, check out Healy (2018), Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction with a draft at https://socviz.co/9. There are a growing number of excellent books on data visualization. 4.6 Cross-tabs Visualizations and Tables each have their strengths. A rule of thumb is that more than a dozen numbers on a table is too much to digest, but less than a dozen is too few for a figure to be worth it. Let’s look at a table first. A cross-tab is counting with two types of variables, and is a simple and powerful tool to show the relationship between multiple variables. xtab_race_state &lt;- table(cen10$state, cen10$race) xtab_race_state ## ## American Indian or Alaska Native Black/Negro Chinese ## Alabama 2 128 1 ## Alaska 11 6 0 ## Arizona 28 23 1 ## Arkansas 1 45 0 ## California 42 253 141 ## Colorado 7 26 3 ## Connecticut 1 39 7 ## Delaware 3 28 1 ## District of Columbia 0 35 0 ## Florida 9 304 4 ## Georgia 2 304 5 ## Hawaii 0 0 2 ## Idaho 2 0 0 ## Illinois 5 194 6 ## Indiana 2 66 3 ## Iowa 0 9 1 ## Kansas 2 24 2 ## Kentucky 2 35 2 ## Louisiana 3 161 1 ## Maine 0 4 1 ## Maryland 2 177 4 ## Massachusetts 5 38 15 ## Michigan 5 147 8 ## Minnesota 6 25 5 ## Mississippi 1 116 0 ## Missouri 4 74 2 ## Montana 8 0 0 ## Nebraska 2 11 0 ## Nevada 6 15 6 ## New Hampshire 1 1 1 ## New Jersey 0 130 19 ## New Mexico 21 3 1 ## New York 13 305 55 ## North Carolina 12 220 4 ## North Dakota 4 1 0 ## Ohio 1 122 5 ## Oklahoma 21 20 0 ## Oregon 5 5 4 ## Pennsylvania 2 156 10 ## Rhode Island 2 3 0 ## South Carolina 2 120 1 ## South Dakota 7 1 0 ## Tennessee 0 97 0 ## Texas 14 316 15 ## Utah 8 0 1 ## Vermont 0 2 0 ## Virginia 0 171 8 ## Washington 14 20 9 ## West Virginia 0 5 0 ## Wisconsin 6 27 0 ## Wyoming 1 1 0 ## ## Japanese Other Asian or Pacific Islander Other race, nec ## Alabama 0 3 8 ## Alaska 0 5 2 ## Arizona 0 12 74 ## Arkansas 0 1 11 ## California 27 359 585 ## Colorado 0 10 28 ## Connecticut 0 16 20 ## Delaware 0 4 5 ## District of Columbia 0 1 1 ## Florida 1 24 72 ## Georgia 0 35 35 ## Hawaii 16 35 0 ## Idaho 1 0 8 ## Illinois 3 53 75 ## Indiana 0 8 20 ## Iowa 0 4 10 ## Kansas 0 8 6 ## Kentucky 0 4 5 ## Louisiana 0 5 7 ## Maine 0 1 0 ## Maryland 1 12 28 ## Massachusetts 2 28 26 ## Michigan 1 23 8 ## Minnesota 1 28 13 ## Mississippi 0 3 2 ## Missouri 0 9 6 ## Montana 0 0 1 ## Nebraska 0 5 6 ## Nevada 2 15 41 ## New Hampshire 1 3 1 ## New Jersey 2 65 69 ## New Mexico 1 1 23 ## New York 3 68 154 ## North Carolina 1 12 40 ## North Dakota 0 0 0 ## Ohio 2 17 7 ## Oklahoma 0 5 15 ## Oregon 0 11 21 ## Pennsylvania 1 28 30 ## Rhode Island 0 4 6 ## South Carolina 0 4 6 ## South Dakota 1 1 2 ## Tennessee 0 13 13 ## Texas 2 92 253 ## Utah 1 6 14 ## Vermont 0 0 1 ## Virginia 2 29 29 ## Washington 4 46 37 ## West Virginia 0 0 0 ## Wisconsin 1 11 13 ## Wyoming 0 2 2 ## ## Three or more major races Two major races White ## Alabama 1 8 344 ## Alaska 0 15 37 ## Arizona 2 11 485 ## Arkansas 1 2 247 ## California 14 174 2168 ## Colorado 1 22 401 ## Connecticut 1 7 284 ## Delaware 1 1 66 ## District of Columbia 0 2 21 ## Florida 2 42 1435 ## Georgia 1 21 587 ## Hawaii 14 27 39 ## Idaho 1 6 129 ## Illinois 2 35 856 ## Indiana 1 6 514 ## Iowa 0 8 287 ## Kansas 0 8 237 ## Kentucky 1 9 357 ## Louisiana 0 6 273 ## Maine 0 1 117 ## Maryland 1 13 302 ## Massachusetts 0 18 515 ## Michigan 2 23 792 ## Minnesota 1 10 483 ## Mississippi 2 1 167 ## Missouri 2 14 516 ## Montana 0 0 88 ## Nebraska 0 5 155 ## Nevada 1 16 171 ## New Hampshire 0 1 129 ## New Jersey 3 25 589 ## New Mexico 1 6 146 ## New York 8 51 1220 ## North Carolina 2 20 648 ## North Dakota 0 1 46 ## Ohio 3 20 931 ## Oklahoma 3 24 266 ## Oregon 4 9 279 ## Pennsylvania 1 27 1045 ## Rhode Island 1 4 74 ## South Carolina 1 6 325 ## South Dakota 0 2 72 ## Tennessee 0 9 474 ## Texas 2 71 1792 ## Utah 0 8 255 ## Vermont 0 4 59 ## Virginia 4 24 548 ## Washington 2 33 524 ## West Virginia 0 3 168 ## Wisconsin 1 8 497 ## Wyoming 0 2 47 Another function to make a cross-tab is the xtabs command, which uses formula notation. xtabs(~ state + race, cen10) What if we care about proportions within states, rather than counts? Say we’d like to compare the racial composition of a small state (like Delaware) and a large state (like California). In fact, most tasks of inference is about the unobserved population, not the observed data — and proportions are estimates of a quantity in the population. One way to transform a table of counts to a table of proportions is the function prop.table. Be careful what you want to take proportions of – this is set by the margin argument. In R, the first margin (margin = 1) is rows and the second (margin = 2) is columns. ptab_race_state &lt;- prop.table(xtab_race_state, margin = 2) Check out each of these table objects in your console and familiarize yourself with the difference. 4.7 Composition Plots How would you make the same figure with ggplot()? First, we want a count for each state \\(\\times\\) race combination. So group by those two factors and count how many observations are in each two-way categorization. group_by() can take any number of variables, separated by commas. grp_race_state &lt;- cen10 %&gt;% count(race, state) Can you tell from the code what grp_race_state will look like? # run on your own grp_race_state Now, we want to tell ggplot2 something like the following: I want bars by state, where heights indicate racial groups. Each bar should be colored by the race. With some googling, you will get something like this: ggplot(data = grp_race_state, aes(x = state, y = n, fill = race)) + geom_col(position = &quot;fill&quot;) + # the position is determined by the fill ae scale_fill_brewer(name = &quot;Census Race&quot;, palette = &quot;OrRd&quot;, direction = -1) + # choose palette coord_flip() + # flip axes scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + # label numbers as percentage labs(y = &quot;Proportion of Racial Group within State&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, source = &quot;Source: 2010 Census sample&quot;) + theme_minimal() 4.8 Line graphs Line graphs are useful for plotting time trends. The Census does not track individuals over time. So let’s take up another example: The U.S. Supreme Court. Take the dataset justices_court-median.csv. This data is adapted from the estimates of Martin and Quinn on their website http://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/.10 justice &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/input/justices_court-median.csv&quot;) What does the data look like? How do you think it is organized? What does each row represent? justice ## # A tibble: 746 × 7 ## term justice_id justice idealpt idealpt_sd median_idealpt median_justice ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1937 67 McReynolds 3.44 0.54 -0.568 Brandeis ## 2 1937 68 Brandeis -0.612 0.271 -0.568 Brandeis ## 3 1937 71 Sutherland 1.59 0.549 -0.568 Brandeis ## 4 1937 72 Butler 2.06 0.426 -0.568 Brandeis ## 5 1937 74 Stone -0.774 0.259 -0.568 Brandeis ## 6 1937 75 Hughes2 -0.368 0.232 -0.568 Brandeis ## 7 1937 76 O. Roberts 0.008 0.228 -0.568 Brandeis ## 8 1937 77 Cardozo -1.59 0.634 -0.568 Brandeis ## 9 1937 78 Black -2.90 0.334 -0.568 Brandeis ## 10 1937 79 Reed -1.06 0.342 -0.568 Brandeis ## # … with 736 more rows ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows As you might have guessed, these data can be shown in a time trend from the range of the term variable. As there are only nine justices at any given time and justices have life tenure, there times on the court are staggered. With a common measure of “preference”, we can plot time trends of these justices ideal points on the same y-axis scale. ggplot(justice, aes(x = term, y = idealpt)) + geom_line() Why does the above graph not look like the the put in the beginning? Fix it by adding just one aesthetic to the graph. # enter a correction that draws separate lines by group. If you got the right aesthetic, this seems to “work” off the shelf. But take a moment to see why the code was written as it is and how that maps on to the graphics. What is the group aesthetic doing for you? Now, this graphic already indicates a lot, but let’s improve the graphics so people can actually read it. This is left for a Exercise. As social scientists, we should also not forget to ask ourselves whether these numerical measures are fit for what we care about, or actually succeeds in measuring what we’d like to measure. The estimation of these “ideal points” is a subfield of political methodology beyond this prefresher. For more reading, skim through the original paper by Martin and Quinn (2002).11 Also for a methodological discussion on the difficulty of measuring time series of preferences, check out Bailey (2013).12 Persily, Nathaniel. 2011. “The Law of the Census: How to Count, What to Count, Whom to Count, and Where to Count Them.”.

Axelrod (1977) demonstrated via simulation how atomized individuals evolve to be grouped in similar clusters or countries, a model of culture.14 Chen and Rodden (2013) argued in a 2013 article that the vote-seat inequality in U.S. elections that is often attributed to intentional partisan gerrymandering can actually attributed to simply the reality of “human geography” – Democratic voters tend to be concentrated in smaller area. Put another way, no feasible form of gerrymandering could spread out Democratic voters in such a way to equalize their vote-seat translation effectiveness. After demonstrating the empirical pattern of human geography, they advance their key claim by simulating thousands of redistricting plans and record the vote-seat ratio.15 Gary King, James Honaker, and multiple other authors propose a way to analyze missing data with a method of multiple imputation, which uses a lot of simulation from a researcher’s observed dataset.16 (Software: Amelia17) Statistical methods also incorporate simulation: The bootstrap: a statistical method for estimating uncertainty around some parameter by re-sampling observations. Bagging: a method for improving machine learning predictions by re-sampling observations, storing the estimate across many re-samples, and averaging these estimates to form the final estimate. A variance reduction technique. Statistical reasoning: if you are trying to understand a quantitative problem, a wonderful first-step to understand the problem better is to simulate it! The analytical solution is often very hard (or impossible), but the simulation is often much easier :-) Where are we? Where are we headed? Up till now, you should have covered: R basics Visualization Matrices and vectors Functions, objects, loops Joining real data In this module, we will start to work with generating data within R, from thin air, as it were. Doing simulation also strengthens your understanding of Probability (Section @ref{probability}). Check your Understanding What does the sample() function do? What does runif() stand for? What is a seed? What is a Monte Carlo? Check if you have an idea of how you might code the following tasks: Simulate 100 rolls of a die Simulate one random ordering of 25 numbers Simulate 100 values of white noise (uniform random variables) Generate a “bootstrap” sample of an existing dataset We’re going to learn about this today! 5.1 Pick a sample, any sample 5.2 The sample() function The core functions for coding up stochastic data revolves around several key functions, so we will simply review them here. Suppose you have a vector of values x and from it you want to randomly sample a sample of length size. For this, use the sample function sample(x = 1:10, size = 5) ## [1] 4 2 8 9 10 There are two subtypes of sampling – with and without replacement. Sampling without replacement (replace = FALSE) means once an element of x is chosen, it will not be considered again: sample(x = 1:10, size = 10, replace = FALSE) ## no number appears more than once ## [1] 10 9 3 4 8 6 2 5 1 7 Sampling with replacement (replace = TRUE) means that even if an element of x is chosen, it is put back in the pool and may be chosen again. sample(x = 1:10, size = 10, replace = TRUE) ## any number can appear more than once ## [1] 8 3 3 2 2 7 6 6 8 4 It follows then that you cannot sample without replacement a sample that is larger than the pool. sample(x = 1:10, size = 100, replace = FALSE) ## Error in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): cannot take a sample larger than the population when &#39;replace = FALSE&#39; So far, every element in x has had an equal probability of being chosen. In some application, we want a sampling scheme where some elements are more likely to be chosen than others. The argument prob handles this. For example, this simulates 20 fair coin tosses (each outcome is equally likely to happen) sample(c(&quot;Head&quot;, &quot;Tail&quot;), size = 20, prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; ## [11] &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; But this simulates 20 biased coin tosses, where say the probability of Tails is 4 times more likely than the number of Heads sample(c(&quot;Head&quot;, &quot;Tail&quot;), size = 20, prob = c(0.2, 0.8), replace = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; ## [11] &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Tail&quot; 5.2.1 Sampling rows from a dataframe In tidyverse, there is a convenience function to sample rows randomly: sample_n() and sample_frac(). For example, load the dataset on cars, mtcars, which has 32 observations. mtcars ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 ## Duster 360 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 280 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 280C 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 sample_n picks a user-specified number of rows from the dataset: sample_n(mtcars, 3) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 Sometimes you want a X percent sample of your dataset.

Testing your analysis with a small sample: If running analyses on a dataset takes more than a handful of seconds, change your dataset upstream to a fraction of the size so the rest of the code runs in less than a second. Once verifying your analysis code runs, then re-do it with your full dataset (by simply removing the sample_n / sample_frac line of code in the beginning). While three seconds may not sound like much, they accumulate and eat up time. 5.3 Random numbers from specific distributions rbinom() rbinom builds upon sample as a tool to help you answer the question – what is the total number of successes I would get if I sampled a binary (Bernoulli) result from a test with size number of trials each, with a event-wise probability of prob. The first argument n asks me how many such numbers I want. For example, I want to know how many Heads I would get if I flipped a fair coin 100 times. rbinom(n = 1, size = 100, prob = 0.5) ## [1] 49 Now imagine this I wanted to do this experiment 10 times, which would require I flip the coin 10 x 100 = 1000 times! Helpfully, we can do this in one line rbinom(n = 10, size = 100, prob = 0.5) ## [1] 42 47 54 46 50 44 51 50 51 45 runif() runif also simulates a stochastic scheme where each event has equal probability of getting chosen like sample, but is a continuous rather than discrete system. We will cover this more in the next math module. The intuition to emphasize here is that one can generate potentially infinite amounts (size n) of noise that is a essentially random runif(n = 5) ## [1] 0.1097412 0.9292395 0.3095468 0.7333913 0.3997090 rnorm() rnorm is also a continuous distribution, but draws from a Normal distribution – perhaps the most important distribution in statistics. It runs the same way as runif rnorm(n = 5) ## [1] -1.4822125 -0.1380801 0.4746995 0.2520717 -0.6706818 To better visualize the difference between the output of runif and rnorm, let’s generate lots of each and plot a histogram. from_runif &lt;- runif(n = 1000) from_rnorm &lt;- rnorm(n = 1000) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) ## base-R parameter for two plots at once hist(from_runif) hist(from_rnorm) 5.4 r, p, and d Each distribution can do more than generate random numbers (the prefix r). We can compute the cumulative probability by the function pbinom(), punif(), and pnorm(). Also the density – the value of the PDF – by dbinom(), dunif() and dnorm(). 5.5 set.seed() R doesn’t have the ability to generate truly random numbers! Random numbers are actually very hard to generate. (Think: flipping a coin –&gt; can be perfectly predicted if I know wind speed, the angle the coin is flipped, etc.). Some people use random noise in the atmosphere or random behavior in quantum systems to generate “truly” (?) random numbers. Conversely, R uses deterministic algorithms which take as an input a “seed” and which then perform a series of operations to generate a sequence of random-seeming numbers (that is, numbers whose sequence is sufficiently hard to predict). Let’s think about this another way. Sampling is a stochastic process, so every time you run sample() or runif() you are bound to get a different output (because different random seeds are used). This is intentional in some cases but you might want to avoid it in others. For example, you might want to diagnose a coding discrepancy by setting the random number generator to give the same number each time. To do this, use the function set.seed(). In the function goes any number. When you run a sample function in the same command as a preceding set.seed(), the sampling function will always give you the same sequence of numbers. In a sense, the sampler is no longer random (in the sense of unpredictable to use; remember: it never was “truly” random in the first place) set.seed(02138) runif(n = 10) ## [1] 0.51236144 0.61530551 0.37451441 0.43541258 0.21166530 0.17812129 ## [7] 0.04420775 0.45567854 0.88718264 0.06970056 The random number generator should give you the exact same sequence of numbers if you precede the function by the same seed, set.seed(02138) runif(n = 10) ## [1] 0.51236144 0.61530551 0.37451441 0.43541258 0.21166530 0.17812129 ## [7] 0.04420775 0.45567854 0.88718264 0.06970056 Exercises Census Sampling What can we learn from surveys of populations, and how wrong do we get if our sampling is biased?18 Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of U.S. residents who are non-white (race != \"White\"). In reality, we do not have any population dataset to utilize and so we only see the sample survey. Here, however, to understand how sampling works, let’s conveniently use the Census extract in some cases and pretend we didn’t in others. First, load usc2010_001percent.csv into your R session. After loading the library(tidyverse), browse it. Although this is only a 0.01 percent extract, treat this as your population for pedagogical purposes. What is the population proportion of non-White residents? Setting a seed to 1669482, sample 100 respondents from this sample. What is the proportion of non-White residents in this particular sample? By how many percentage points are you off from (what we labelled as) the true proportion? Now imagine what you did above was one survey. What would we get if we did 20 surveys? To simulate this, write a loop that does the same exercise 20 times, each time computing a sample proportion. Use the same seed at the top, but be careful to position the set.seed function such that it generates the same sequence of 20 samples, rather than 20 of the same sample. Try doing this with a for loop and storing your sample proportions in a new length-20 vector. (Suggestion: make an empty vector first as a container). After running the loop, show a histogram of the 20 values. Also what is the average of the 20 sample estimates? Now, to make things more real, let’s introduce some response bias. The goal here is not to correct response bias but to induce it and see how it affects our estimates. Suppose that non-White residents are 10 percent less likely to respond to enter your survey than White respondents. This is plausible if you think that the Census is from 2010 but you are polling in 2018, and racial minorities are more geographically mobile than Whites. Repeat the same exercise in (c) by modeling this behavior. You can do this by creating a variable, e.g. propensity, that is 0.9 for non-Whites and 1 otherwise. Then, you can refer to it in the propensity argument. Finally, we want to see if more data (“Big Data”) will improve our estimates. Using the same unequal response rates framework as (d), repeat the same exercise but instead of each poll collecting 100 responses, we collect 10,000. Optional - visualize your 2 pairs of 20 estimates, with a bar showing the “correct” population average. Conditional Proportions This example is not on simulation, but is meant to reinforce some of the probability discussion from math lecture. Read in the Upshot Siena poll from Fall 2016, data/input/upshot-siena-polls.csv. In addition to some standard demographic questions, we will focus on one called vt_pres_2 in the csv. This is a two-way presidential vote question, asking respondents who they plan to vote for President if the election were held today – Donald Trump, the Republican, or Hilary Clinton, the Democrat, with options for Other candidates as well. For this problem, use the two-way vote question rather than the 4-way vote question. Drop the the respondents who answered the November poll (i.e. those for which poll == \"November\"). We do this in order to ignore this November population in all subsequent parts of this question because they were not asked the Presidential vote question. Using the dataset after the procedure in (a), find the proportion of poll respondents (those who are in the sample) who support Donald Trump. Among those who supported Donald Trump, what proportion of them has a Bachelor’s degree or higher (i.e. have a Bachelor’s, Graduate, or other Professional Degree)? Among those who did not support Donald Trump (i.e. including supporters of Hilary Clinton, another candidate, or those who refused to answer the question), what proportion of them has a Bachelor’s degree or higher? Express the numbers in the previous parts as probabilities of specified events. Define your own symbols: For example, we can let \\(T\\) be the event that a randomly selected respondent in the poll supports Donald Trump, then the proportion in part (b) is the probability \\(P(T).\\) Suppose we randomly sampled a person who participated in the survey and found that he/she had a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Given this evidence, what is the probability that the same person supports Donald Trump? Use Bayes Rule and show your work – that is, do not use data or R to compute the quantity directly. Then, verify this is the case via R. The Birthday problem Write code that will answer the well-known birthday problem via simulation.19 The problem is fairly simple: Suppose \\(k\\) people gather together in a room. What is the probability at least two people share the same birthday? To simplify reality a bit, assume that (1) there are no leap years, and so there are always 365 days in a year, and (2) a given individual’s birthday is randomly assigned and independent from each other. Step 1: Set k to a concrete number. Pick a number from 1 to 365 randomly, k times to simulate birthdays (would this be with replacement or without?). # Your code Step 2: Write a line (or two) of code that gives a TRUE or FALSE statement of whether or not at least two people share the same birth date. # Your code Step 3: The above steps will generate a TRUE or FALSE answer for your event of interest, but only for one realization of an event in the sample space. In order to estimate the probability of your event happening, we need a “stochastic”, as opposed to “deterministic”, method. To do this, write a loop that does Steps 1 and 2 repeatedly for many times, call that number of times sims. For each of sims iteration, your code should give you a TRUE or FALSE answer. Code up a way to store these estimates. # Your code Step 4: Finally, generalize the function further by letting k be a user-defined number. You have now created a Monte Carlo simulation! # Your code Step 5: Generate a table or plot that shows how the probability of sharing a birthday changes by k (fixing sims at a large number like 1000). Also generate a similar plot that shows how the probability of sharing a birthday changes by sims (fixing k at some arbitrary number like 10). # Your code Extra credit: Give an “analytical” answer to this problem, that is an answer through deriving the mathematical expressions of the probability. # Your equations Module originally written by Connor Jerzak and Shiro Kuriwaki↩︎ Axelrod, Robert. 1997. “The Dissemination of Culture.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 41(2): 203–26.↩︎ Chen, Jowei, and Jonathan Rodden. “Unintentional Gerrymandering: Political Geography and Electoral Bias in Legislatures.

Where are we headed? Up till now, you should have covered: Statistical Programming in R This is only the beginning of R – programming is like learning a language, so learn more as we use it. And yet R is of likely not the only programming language you will want to use. While we cannot introduce everything, we’ll pick out a few that we think are particularly helpful. Here will cover Markdown LaTeX (and BibTeX) as examples of a non-WYSIWYG editor command-line are a basic set of tools that you may have to use from time to time. It also clarifies what more complicated programs are doing. Markdown is an example of compiling a plain text file. LaTeX is a typesetting program and git is a version control program – both are useful for non-quantitative work as well. Please familiarize yourself closing with Markdown, and be sure you know how to open an .Rmd file as described below. In class, we will walk through an Rmd file together. LaTeX is included here for your future reference as this is a popular typesetting program among political scientists. This is not needed for Math Camp and is never required for any course. In fact, many prefer R Markdown’s integration rather than a separate typesetting program. This depends on your background and interests but exposure to the range of popular programs and techniques will be helpful moving forward. Check your understanding Check if you have an idea of how you might code the following tasks: What does “WYSIWYG” stand for? How would a non-WYSIWYG format text? How do you start a header in markdown? What are some “plain text” editors? How do you start a document in .tex? How do you start a environment in .tex? How do you insert a figure in .tex? How do you reference a figure in .tex? What is a .bib file? Say you came across a interesting journal article. How would you want to maintain this reference so that you can refer to its citation in all your subsequent papers? 6.1 Motivation Statistical programming is a fast-moving field. The beta version of R was released in 2000, ggplot2 was released on 2005, and RStudio started around 2010. Of course, some programming technologies are quite “old”: (C in 1969, C++ around 1989, TeX in 1978, Linux in 1991, Mac OS in 1984). But it is easy to feel you are falling behind in the recent developments of programming. Today we will do a brief and rough overview of some fundamental and new tools other than R, with the general aim of having you break out of your comfort zone so you won’t be shut out from learning these tools in the future. 6.2 Markdown At its core markdown is just plain text. Plain text does not have any formatting embedded in it. Instead, the formatting is coded up as text. Markdown is not a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) text editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This will mean that you need to explicitly code for bold{text} rather than hitting Command+B and making your text look bold on your own computer. Markdown is known as a “light-weight” editor, which means that it is relatively easy to write code that will compile. It is quick and easy and satisfies most presentation purposes; you might want to try LaTeX for more involved papers. 6.2.1 markdown commands For italic and bold, use either the asterisks or the underlines, *italic* **bold** _italic_ __bold__ And for headers use the hash symbols, # Main Header ## Sub-headers 6.2.2 your own markdown RStudio makes it easy to compile your very first markdown file by giving you templates. Got to New &gt; R Markdown, pick a document and click Ok. This will give you a skeleton of a document you can compile – or “knit”. Rmd is actually a slight modification of real markdown. It is a type of file that R reads and turns into a proper md file. Then, it uses a document-conversion called pandoc to compile your md into documents like PDF or HTML. How Rmds become PDFs or HTMLs 6.2.3 A note on plain-text editors Multiple software exist where you can edit plain-text (roughly speaking, text that is not WYSIWYG). RStudio (especially for R-related links) TeXMaker, TeXShop (especially for TeX) emacs, aquamacs (general) vim (general) Sublime Text (general) Atom (general) Each has their own keyboard shortcuts and special features. You can browse a couple and see which one(s) you like. 6.3 LaTeX LaTeX is a typesetting program. You’d engage with LaTeX much like you engage with your R code. You will interact with LaTeX in a text editor, and will writing code which will be interpreted by the LaTeX compiler and which will finally be parsed to form your final PDF. 6.3.1 compile online Go to https://www.overleaf.com Scroll down and go to “CREATE A NEW PAPER” if you don’t have an account. Let’s discuss the default template. Make a new document, and set it as your main document. Then type in the Minimal Working Example (MWE): \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} Hello World \\end{document} 6.3.2 compile your first LaTeX document locally LaTeX is a very stable system, and few changes to it have been made since the 1990s. The main benefit: better control over how your papers will look; better methods for writing equations or making tables; overall pleasing aesthetic. Open a plain text editor. Then type in the MWE \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} Hello World \\end{document} Save this as hello_world.tex. Make sure you get the file extension right. Open this in your “LaTeX” editor. This can be TeXMaker, Aqumacs, etc.. Go through the click/dropdown interface and click compile. 6.3.3 main LaTeX commands LaTeX can cover most of your typesetting needs, to clean equations and intricate diagrams. Some main commands you’ll be using are below, and a very concise cheat sheet here: https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf Most involved features require that you begin a specific “environment” for that feature, clearly demarcating them by the notation \\begin{figure} and then \\end{figure}, e.g. in the case of figures. \\begin{figure} \\includegraphics{histogram.pdf} \\end{figure} where histogram.pdf is a path to one of your files. Notice that each line starts with a backslash \\ – in LaTeX this is the symbol to run a command. The following syntax at the endpoints are shorthand for math equations. \\[\\int x^2 dx\\] these compile math symbols: \\(\\displaystyle \\int x^2 dx.\\)20 The align environment is useful to align your multi-line math, for example. \\begin{align} P(A \\mid B) &amp;= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\end{align} \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\mid B) &amp;= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\end{align}\\] Regression tables should be outputted as .tex files with packages like xtable and stargazer, and then called into LaTeX by \\input{regression_table.tex} where regression_table.tex is the path to your regression output. Figures and equations should be labelled with the tag (e.g. label{tab:regression} so that you can refer to them later with their tag Table \\ref{tab:regression}, instead of hard-coding Table 2). For some LaTeX commands you might need to load a separate package that someone else has written. Do this in your preamble (i.e. before \\begin{document}): \\usepackage[options]{package} where package is the name of the package and options are options specific to the package. Further Guides For a more comprehensive listing of LaTeX commands, Mayya Komisarchik has a great tutorial set of folders: https://scholar.harvard.edu/mkomisarchik/tutorials-0 There is a version of LaTeX called Beamer, which is a popular way of making a slideshow. Slides in markdown is also a competitor. The language of Beamer is the same as LaTeX but has some special functions for slides. 6.4 BibTeX BibTeX is a reference system for bibliographical tests. We have a .bib file separately on our computer. This is also a plain text file, but it encodes bibliographical resources with special syntax so that a program can rearrange parts accordingly for different citation systems. 6.4.1 what is a .bib file? For example, here is the Nunn and Wantchekon article entry in .bib form. @article{nunn2011slave, title={The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa}, author={Nunn, Nathan and Wantchekon, Leonard}, journal={American Economic Review}, volume={101}, number={7}, pages={3221--3252}, year={2011} } The first entry, nunn2011slave, is “pick your favorite” – pick your own name for your reference system. The other slots in this @article entry are entries that refer to specific bibliographical text. 6.4.2 what does LaTeX do with .bib files? Now, in LaTeX, if you type \\textcite{nunn2011slave} argue that current variation in the trust among citizens of African countries has historical roots in the European slave trade in the 1600s. as part of your text, then when the .tex file is compiled the PDF shows something like in whatever citation style (APSA, APA, Chicago) you pre-specified! Also at the end of your paper you will have a bibliography with entries ordered and formatted in the appropriate citation. This is a much less frustrating way of keeping track of your references – no need to hand-edit formatting the bibliography to conform to citation rules (which biblatex already knows) and no need to update your bibliography as you add and drop references (biblatex will only show entries that are used in the main text). 6.4.3 stocking up on your .bib files You should keep your own .bib file that has all your bibliographical resources. Storing entries is cheap (does not take much memory), so it is fine to keep all your references in one place (but you’ll want to make a new one for collaborative projects where multiple people will compile a .tex file). For example, Gary’s BibTeX file is here: https://github.com/iqss-research/gkbibtex/blob/master/gk.bib Citation management software (Mendeley or Zotero) automatically generates .bib entries from your library of PDFs for you, provided you have the bibliography attributes right. Extension: Optional Exercise Create a LaTeX document for a hypothetical research paper on your laptop and, once you’ve verified it compiles into a PDF, come show it to either one of the instructors. You can also use overleaf if you have preference for a cloud-based system. But don’t swallow the built-in templates without understanding or testing them. Each student will have slightly different substantive interests, so we won’t impose much of a standard. But at a minimum, the LaTeX document should have: A title, author, date, and abstract Sections Italics and boldface A figure with a caption and in-text reference to it. Depending on your subfield or interests, try to implement some of the following: A bibliographical reference drawing from a separate .bib file A table A math expression A different font Different page margins Different line spacing Enclosing with $$ instead of \\[ also has the same effect, so you may see it too. But this is now discouraged due to its inflexibility.↩︎ "],["linearalgebra.html", "Chapter 7 Linear Algebra 7.1 Working with Vectors 7.2 Linear Independence 7.3 Basics of Matrix Algebra 7.4 Systems of Linear Equations 7.5 Systems of Equations as Matrices 7.6 Finding Solutions to Augmented Matrices and Systems of Equations 7.7 Rank — and Whether a System Has One, Infinite, or No Solutions 7.8 The Inverse of a Matrix 7.9 Linear Systems and Inverses 7.10 Determinants 7.11 Getting Inverse of a Matrix using its Determinant Answers to Examples and Exercises", " Chapter 7 Linear Algebra Topics: \\(\\bullet\\) Working with Vectors \\(\\bullet\\) Linear Independence \\(\\bullet\\) Basics of Matrix Algebra \\(\\bullet\\) Square Matrices \\(\\bullet\\) Linear Equations \\(\\bullet\\) Systems of Linear Equations \\(\\bullet\\) Systems of Equations as Matrices \\(\\bullet\\) Solving Augmented Matrices and Systems of Equations \\(\\bullet\\) Rank \\(\\bullet\\) The Inverse of a Matrix \\(\\bullet\\) Inverse of Larger Matrices 7.1 Working with Vectors Vector: A vector in \\(n\\)-space is an ordered list of \\(n\\) numbers. These numbers can be represented as either a row vector or a column vector: \\[ {\\bf v} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; \\dots &amp; v_n\\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\] We can also think of a vector as defining a point in \\(n\\)-dimensional space, usually \\({\\bf R}^n\\); each element of the vector defines the coordinate of the point in a particular direction. Vector Addition and Subtraction: If two vectors, \\({\\bf u}\\) and \\({\\bf v}\\), have the same length (i.e. have the same number of elements), they can be added (subtracted) together: \\[ {\\bf u} + {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 &amp; u_2 + v_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_k + v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ {\\bf u} - {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_1 &amp; u_2 - v_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_k - v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\] Scalar Multiplication: The product of a scalar \\(c\\) (i.e. a constant) and vector \\({\\bf v}\\) is: \\[ c{\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} cv_1 &amp; cv_2 &amp; \\dots &amp; cv_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] Vector Inner Product: The inner product (also called the dot product or scalar product) of two vectors \\({\\bf u}\\) and \\({\\bf v}\\) is again defined if and only if they have the same number of elements \\[ {\\bf u} \\cdot {\\bf v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \\cdots + u_nv_n = \\sum_{i = 1}^n u_iv_i\\] If \\({\\bf u} \\cdot {\\bf v} = 0\\), the two vectors are orthogonal (or perpendicular). Vector Norm: The norm of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many different ways to calculate the norm, but the most common is the Euclidean norm (which corresponds to our usual conception of distance in three-dimensional space): \\[ ||{\\bf v}|| = \\sqrt{{\\bf v}\\cdot{\\bf v}} = \\sqrt{ v_1v_1 + v_2v_2 + \\cdots + v_nv_n}\\] Example 7.1 (Vector Algebra) Let \\(a = \\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;1&amp;2\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(b = \\begin{pmatrix} 3&amp;4&amp;5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Calculate the following: \\(a - b\\) \\(a \\cdot b\\) Exercise 7.1 (Vector Algebra) Let \\(u = \\begin{pmatrix} 7&amp;1&amp;-5&amp;3\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(v = \\begin{pmatrix} 9&amp;-3&amp;2&amp;8 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(w = \\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;13&amp; -7&amp;2 &amp;15 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and \\(c = 2\\). Calculate the following: \\(u-v\\) \\(cw\\) \\(u \\cdot v\\) \\(w \\cdot v\\) 7.2 Linear Independence Linear combinations: The vector \\({\\bf u}\\) is a linear combination of the vectors \\({\\bf v}_1, {\\bf v}_2, \\cdots , {\\bf v}_k\\) if \\[{\\bf u} = c_1{\\bf v}_1 + c_2{\\bf v}_2 + \\cdots + c_k{\\bf v}_k\\] For example, \\(\\begin{pmatrix}9 &amp; 13 &amp; 17 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a linear combination of the following three vectors: \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3&amp; 4\\end{pmatrix}\\), and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This is because \\(\\begin{pmatrix}9 &amp; 13 &amp; 17 \\end{pmatrix}\\) = \\((2)\\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(+ (-1)\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3&amp; 4\\end{pmatrix}\\) + \\(3\\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Linear independence: A set of vectors \\({\\bf v}_1, {\\bf v}_2, \\cdots , {\\bf v}_k\\) is linearly independent if the only solution to the equation \\[c_1{\\bf v}_1 + c_2{\\bf v}_2 + \\cdots + c_k{\\bf v}_k = 0\\] is \\(c_1 = c_2 = \\cdots = c_k = 0\\). If another solution exists, the set of vectors is linearly dependent. A set \\(S\\) of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in \\(S\\) can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in \\(S\\). Linear independence is only defined for sets of vectors with the same number of elements; any linearly independent set of vectors in \\(n\\)-space contains at most \\(n\\) vectors. Since \\(\\begin{pmatrix}9 &amp; 13 &amp; 17 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a linear combination of \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3&amp; 4\\end{pmatrix}\\), and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\), these 4 vectors constitute a linearly dependent set. Example 7.2 (Linear Independence) Are the following sets of vectors linearly independent? \\(\\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; 6 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and \\(\\begin{pmatrix}10 &amp; 10 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Exercise 7.2 (Linear Independence) Are the following sets of vectors linearly independent? \\[{\\bf v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\] \\[{\\bf v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} \\] 7.3 Basics of Matrix Algebra Matrix: A matrix is an array of real numbers arranged in \\(m\\) rows by \\(n\\) columns. The dimensionality of the matrix is defined as the number of rows by the number of columns, \\(m \\times n\\). \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\] Note that you can think of vectors as special cases of matrices; a column vector of length \\(k\\) is a \\(k \\times 1\\) matrix, while a row vector of the same length is a \\(1 \\times k\\) matrix. It’s also useful to think of matrices as being made up of a collection of row or column vectors. For example, \\[\\bf A = \\begin{pmatrix} {\\bf a}_1 &amp; {\\bf a}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; {\\bf a}_m \\end{pmatrix}\\] Matrix Addition: Let \\(\\bf A\\) and \\(\\bf B\\) be two \\(m\\times n\\) matrices. \\[{\\bf A+B}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}+b_{11} &amp; a_{12}+b_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1n}+b_{1n} \\\\ a_{21}+b_{21} &amp; a_{22}+b_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2n}+b_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1}+b_{m1} &amp; a_{m2}+b_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn}+b_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\] Note that matrices \\({\\bf A}\\) and \\({\\bf B}\\) must have the same dimensionality, in which case they are conformable for addition. Example 7.3 \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\({\\bf A+B}=\\) Scalar Multiplication: Given the scalar \\(s\\), the scalar multiplication of \\(s {\\bf A}\\) is \\[ s {\\bf A}= s \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s a_{11} &amp; s a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; s a_{1n} \\\\ s a_{21} &amp; s a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; s a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ s a_{m1} &amp; s a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; s a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\] Example 7.4 \\(s=2, \\qquad {\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(s {\\bf A} =\\) Matrix Multiplication: If \\({\\bf A}\\) is an \\(m\\times k\\) matrix and \\(\\bf B\\) is a \\(k\\times n\\) matrix, then their product \\(\\bf C = A B\\) is the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix where \\[c_{ij}=a_{i1}b_{1j}+a_{i2}b_{2j}+\\cdots+a_{ik}b_{kj}\\] \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d\\\\e&amp;f \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A&amp;B\\\\C&amp;D \\end{pmatrix} =\\) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;-1\\\\3&amp;1&amp;4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -2&amp;5\\\\4&amp;-3\\\\2&amp;1\\end{pmatrix} =\\) Note that the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix, in which case they are conformable for multiplication. The sizes of the matrices (including the resulting product) must be \\[(m\\times k)(k\\times n)=(m\\times n)\\] Also note that if AB exists, BA exists only if \\(\\dim({\\bf A}) = m \\times n\\) and \\(\\dim({\\bf B}) = n \\times m\\). This does not mean that AB = BA. AB = BA is true only in special circumstances, like when \\({\\bf A}\\) or \\({\\bf B}\\) is an identity matrix or \\({\\bf A} = {\\bf B}^{-1}\\). Laws of Matrix Algebra: Commutative law for multiplication does not hold – the order of multiplication matters: \\[\\bf AB\\ne BA\\] For example, \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;2\\\\-1&amp;3\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;1\\\\0&amp;1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[{\\bf AB}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;3\\\\-2&amp;2\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf BA}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;7\\\\-1&amp;3\\end{pmatrix}\\] Transpose: The transpose of the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(\\bf A\\) is the \\(n\\times m\\) matrix \\({\\bf A}^T\\) (also written \\({\\bf A}&#39;\\)) obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of \\(\\bf A\\). For example, \\({\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 4&amp;-2&amp;3\\\\0&amp;5&amp;-1\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf A}^T=\\begin{pmatrix} 4&amp;0\\\\-2&amp;5\\\\3&amp;-1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\({\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\-1\\\\3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}^T=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;-1&amp;3\\end{pmatrix}\\) The following rules apply for transposed matrices: Example of \\(({\\bf AB})^T = {\\bf B}^T{\\bf A}^T\\): \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;3&amp;2\\\\2&amp;-1&amp;3\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\\\2&amp;2\\\\3&amp;-1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ ({\\bf AB})^T = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;3&amp;2\\\\2&amp;-1&amp;3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\\\2&amp;2\\\\3&amp;-1\\end{pmatrix} \\right]^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 12&amp;7\\\\5&amp;-3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ {\\bf B}^T{\\bf A}^T= \\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;2&amp;3\\\\1&amp;2&amp;-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;2\\\\3&amp;-1\\\\2&amp;3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12&amp;7\\\\5&amp;-3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Exercise 7.3 (Matrix Multiplication) Let \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;1\\\\1&amp;2&amp;0&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;5&amp;-7\\\\1&amp;1&amp;0\\\\0&amp;-1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0&amp;0\\end{pmatrix} \\] \\[C = \\begin{pmatrix} 3&amp;2&amp;-1\\\\0&amp;4&amp;6 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Calculate the following: \\[AB\\] \\[BA\\] \\[(BC)^T\\] \\[BC^T\\] 7.4 Systems of Linear Equations Linear Equation: \\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n = b\\) \\(a_i\\) are parameters or coefficients. \\(x_i\\) are variables or unknowns. Linear because only one variable per term and degree is at most 1. We are often interested in solving linear systems like \\[\\begin{matrix} x &amp; - &amp; 3y &amp; = &amp; -3\\\\ 2x &amp; + &amp; y &amp; = &amp; 8 \\end{matrix}\\] More generally, we might have a system of \\(m\\) equations in \\(n\\) unknowns \\[\\begin{matrix} a_{11}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{12}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{1n}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{22}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{2n}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\\\ a_{m1}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{m2}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{mn}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_m \\end{matrix}\\] A solution to a linear system of \\(m\\) equations in \\(n\\) unknowns is a set of \\(n\\) numbers \\(x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\) that satisfy each of the \\(m\\) equations. Example: \\(x=3\\) and \\(y=2\\) is the solution to the above \\(2\\times 2\\) linear system. If you graph the two lines, you will find that they intersect at \\((3,2)\\). Does a linear system have one, no, or multiple solutions? For a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns (i.e., two lines): _ One solution: The lines intersect at exactly one point. No solution: The lines are parallel. Infinite solutions: The lines coincide. Methods to solve linear systems: Substitution Elimination of variables Matrix methods Exercise 7.4 (Linear Equations) Provide a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns that has one solution no solution infinite solutions 7.5 Systems of Equations as Matrices Matrices provide an easy and efficient way to represent linear systems such as \\[\\begin{matrix} a_{11}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{12}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{1n}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_1\\\\ a_{21}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{22}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{2n}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\\\ a_{m1}x_1 &amp; + &amp; a_{m2}x_2 &amp; + &amp; \\cdots &amp; + &amp; a_{mn}x_n &amp; = &amp; b_m \\end{matrix}\\] as \\[{\\bf A x = b}\\] where The \\(m \\times n\\) \\({\\bf A}\\) is an array of \\(m n\\) real numbers arranged in \\(m\\) rows by \\(n\\) columns: \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn} \\end{pmatrix}\\] The unknown quantities are represented by the vector \\({\\bf x}=\\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\x_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\x_n \\end{pmatrix}\\). The right hand side of the linear system is represented by the vector \\({\\bf b}=\\begin{pmatrix} b_1\\\\b_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\b_m \\end{pmatrix}\\). Augmented Matrix: When we append \\(\\bf b\\) to the coefficient matrix \\(\\bf A\\), we get the augmented matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}=[\\bf A | b]\\) \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1n} &amp; | &amp; b_1\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2n} &amp; | &amp; b_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; | &amp; \\vdots\\\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mn} &amp; | &amp; b_m \\end{pmatrix}\\] Exercise 7.5 (Augmented Matrix) Create an augmented matrix that represent the following system of equations: \\[2x_1 -7x_2 + 9x_3 -4x_4 = 8\\] \\[41x_2 + 9x_3 -5x_6 = 11\\] \\[x_1 -15x_2 -11x_5 = 9\\] 7.6 Finding Solutions to Augmented Matrices and Systems of Equations Row Echelon Form: Our goal is to translate our augmented matrix or system of equations into row echelon form. This will provide us with the values of the vector x which solve the system. We use the row operations to change coefficients in the lower triangle of the augmented matrix to 0. An augmented matrix of the form \\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\fbox{$a&#39;_{11}$}&amp; a&#39;_{12} &amp; a&#39;_{13}&amp; \\cdots &amp; a&#39;_{1n} &amp; | &amp; b&#39;_1\\\\ 0 &amp; \\fbox{$a&#39;_{22}$} &amp; a&#39;_{23}&amp; \\cdots &amp; a&#39;_{2n} &amp; | &amp; b&#39;_2\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\fbox{$a&#39;_{33}$}&amp; \\cdots &amp; a&#39;_{3n} &amp; | &amp; b&#39;_3\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; | &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp; \\fbox{$a&#39;_{mn}$} &amp; | &amp; b&#39;_m \\end{pmatrix}\\] is said to be in row echelon form — each row has more leading zeros than the row preceding it. Reduced Row Echelon Form: We can go one step further and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form. Reduced row echelon form makes the value of x which solves the system very obvious. For a system of \\(m\\) equations in \\(m\\) unknowns, with no all-zero rows, the reduced row echelon form would be \\[\\begin{pmatrix} \\fbox{$1$} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; b^*_1\\\\ 0 &amp; \\fbox{$1$} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; b^*_2\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\fbox{$1$} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp; b^*_3\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;\\ddots &amp; 0 &amp; | &amp;\\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\fbox{$1$} &amp; | &amp; b^*_m \\end{pmatrix}\\] Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination: We can conduct elementary row operations to get our augmented matrix into row echelon or reduced row echelon form. The methods of transforming a matrix or system into row echelon and reduced row echelon form are referred to as Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination, respectively. Elementary Row Operations: To do Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination, we use three basic operations to transform the augmented matrix into another augmented matrix that represents an equivalent linear system – equivalent in the sense that the same values of \\(x_j\\) solve both the original and transformed matrix/system: Interchanging Rows: Suppose we have the augmented matrix \\[{\\widehat{\\bf A}}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; | &amp; b_1\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; | &amp; b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] If we interchange the two rows, we get the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; | &amp; b_2\\\\ a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; | &amp; b_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\). Multiplying by a Constant: If we multiply the second row of matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\) by a constant \\(c\\), we get the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; | &amp; b_1\\\\ c a_{21} &amp; c a_{22} &amp; | &amp; c b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\). Adding (subtracting) Rows: If we add (subtract) the first row of matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\) to the second, we obtain the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; | &amp; b_1\\\\ a_{11}+a_{21} &amp; a_{12}+a_{22} &amp; | &amp; b_1+b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\). Example 7.5 Solve the following system of equations by using elementary row operations: \\(\\begin{matrix} x &amp; - &amp; 3y &amp; = &amp; -3\\\\ 2x &amp; + &amp; y &amp; = &amp; 8 \\end{matrix}\\) Exercise 7.6 (Solving Systems of Equations) Put the following system of equations into augmented matrix form. Then, using Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination, solve the system of equations by putting the matrix into row echelon or reduced row echelon form. \\[ 1. \\begin{cases} x + y + 2z = 2\\\\ 3x - 2y + z = 1\\\\ y - z = 3 \\end{cases} \\] \\[ 2. \\begin{cases} 2x + 3y - z = -8\\\\ x + 2y - z = 12\\\\ -x -4y + z = -6 \\end{cases} \\] 7.7 Rank — and Whether a System Has One, Infinite, or No Solutions To determine how many solutions exist, we can use information about (1) the number of equations \\(m\\), (2) the number of unknowns \\(n\\), and (3) the rank of the matrix representing the linear system. Rank: The maximum number of linearly independent row or column vectors in the matrix. This is equivalent to the number of nonzero rows of a matrix in row echelon form. For any matrix A, the row rank always equals column rank, and we refer to this number as the rank of A. For example \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Rank = 3 \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Rank = 2 Exercise 7.7 (Rank of Matrices) Find the rank of each matrix below: (Hint: transform the matrices into row echelon form. Remember that the number of nonzero rows of a matrix in row echelon form is the rank of that matrix) 1.\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) 2.\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; -3 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Answer to Exercise 7.7: rank is 2 rank is 3 7.8 The Inverse of a Matrix Identity Matrix: The \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix \\({\\bf I}_n\\) is the matrix whose diagonal elements are 1 and all off-diagonal elements are 0. Examples: \\[ {\\bf I}_2=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf I}_3=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Inverse Matrix: An \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\({\\bf A}\\) is nonsingular or invertible if there exists an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) such that \\[{\\bf A} {\\bf A}^{-1} = {\\bf A}^{-1} {\\bf A} = {\\bf I}_n\\] where \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) is the inverse of \\({\\bf A}\\). If there is no such \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\), then \\({\\bf A}\\) is singular or not invertible. Example: Let \\[{\\bf A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;3\\\\2&amp;2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} -1&amp;\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ 1&amp;-1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] Since \\[{\\bf A} {\\bf B} = {\\bf B} {\\bf A} = {\\bf I}_n\\] we conclude that \\({\\bf B}\\) is the inverse, \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\), of \\({\\bf A}\\) and that \\({\\bf A}\\) is nonsingular. Properties of the Inverse: If the inverse exists, it is unique. If \\({\\bf A}\\) is nonsingular, then \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) is nonsingular. \\(({\\bf A}^{-1})^{-1} = {\\bf A}\\) If \\({\\bf A}\\) and \\({\\bf B}\\) are nonsingular, then \\({\\bf A}{\\bf B}\\) is nonsingular \\(({\\bf A}{\\bf B})^{-1} = {\\bf B}^{-1}{\\bf A}^{-1}\\) If \\({\\bf A}\\) is nonsingular, then \\(({\\bf A}^T)^{-1}=({\\bf A}^{-1})^T\\) Procedure to Find \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\): We know that if \\({\\bf B}\\) is the inverse of \\({\\bf A}\\), then \\[{\\bf A} {\\bf B} = {\\bf B} {\\bf A} = {\\bf I}_n\\] Looking only at the first and last parts of this \\[{\\bf A} {\\bf B} = {\\bf I}_n\\] Solving for \\({\\bf B}\\) is equivalent to solving for \\(n\\) linear systems, where each column of \\({\\bf B}\\) is solved for the corresponding column in \\({\\bf I}_n\\). We can solve the systems simultaneously by augmenting \\({\\bf A}\\) with \\({\\bf I}_n\\) and performing Gauss-Jordan elimination on \\({\\bf A}\\). If Gauss-Jordan elimination on \\([{\\bf A} | {\\bf I}_n]\\) results in \\([{\\bf I}_n | {\\bf B} ]\\), then \\({\\bf B}\\) is the inverse of \\({\\bf A}\\). Otherwise, \\({\\bf A}\\) is singular. To summarize: To calculate the inverse of \\({\\bf A}\\) Form the augmented matrix \\([ {\\bf A} | {\\bf I}_n]\\) Using elementary row operations, transform the augmented matrix to reduced row echelon form. The result of step 2 is an augmented matrix \\([ {\\bf C} | {\\bf B} ]\\). If \\({\\bf C}={\\bf I}_n\\), then \\({\\bf B}={\\bf A}^{-1}\\). If \\({\\bf C}\\ne{\\bf I}_n\\), then \\(\\bf C\\) has a row of zeros. This means \\({\\bf A}\\) is singular and \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) does not exist. Example 7.6 Find the inverse of the following matricies: \\({\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;1&amp;1\\\\0&amp;2&amp;3\\\\5&amp;5&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Exercise 7.8 (Finding the inverse of matrices) Find the inverse of the following matrix: \\({\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;4\\\\0&amp;2&amp;0\\\\0&amp;0&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) 7.9 Linear Systems and Inverses Let’s return to the matrix representation of a linear system \\[\\bf{Ax} = \\bf{b}\\] If \\(\\bf{A}\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix,then \\(\\bf{Ax}=\\bf{b}\\) is a system of \\(n\\) equations in \\(n\\) unknowns. Suppose \\(\\bf{A}\\) is nonsingular. Then \\(\\bf{A}^{-1}\\) exists. To solve this system, we can multiply each side by \\(\\bf{A}^{-1}\\) and reduce it as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\bf{A}^{-1} (\\bf{A} \\bf{x}) &amp; = &amp; \\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{b} \\\\ (\\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{A})\\bf{x} &amp; = &amp; \\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{b}\\\\ \\bf{I}_n \\bf{x} &amp; = &amp; \\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{b}\\\\ \\bf{x} &amp; = &amp; \\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{b} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Hence, given \\(\\bf{A}\\) and \\(\\bf{b}\\) and given that \\(\\bf{A}\\) is nonsingular, then \\(\\bf{x} = \\bf{A}^{-1} \\bf{b}\\) is a unique solution to this system. Exercise 7.9 (Solve linear system using inverses) Use the inverse matrix to solve the following linear system: \\[\\begin{align*} -3x + 4y &amp;= 5 \\\\ 2x - y &amp;= -10 \\end{align*}\\] Hint: the linear system above can be written in the matrix form \\(\\textbf{A}\\textbf{z} = \\textbf{b}\\) given \\[\\textbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3&amp;4\\\\2&amp;-1 \\end{pmatrix},\\] \\[\\textbf{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\y \\end{pmatrix},\\] and \\[\\textbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5\\\\-10 \\end{pmatrix}\\] 7.10 Determinants Singularity: Determinants can be used to determine whether a square matrix is nonsingular. A square matrix is nonsingular if and only if its determinant is not zero. Determinant of a \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix, A, equals \\(a_{11}\\) Determinant of a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix, A, \\(\\begin{vmatrix} a_{11}&amp;a_{12}\\\\ a_{21}&amp;a_{22} \\end{vmatrix}\\): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\det({\\bf A}) &amp;=&amp; |{\\bf A}|\\\\ &amp;=&amp; a_{11}|a_{22}| - a_{12}|a_{21}|\\\\ &amp;=&amp; a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] We can extend the second to last equation above to get the definition of the determinant of a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22}&amp;a_{23}\\\\ a_{31}&amp;a_{32}&amp;a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} &amp;=&amp; a_{11} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{22}&amp;a_{23}\\\\ a_{32}&amp;a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} - a_{12} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{21}&amp;a_{23}\\\\ a_{31}&amp;a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} + a_{13} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{21}&amp;a_{22}\\\\ a_{31}&amp;a_{32} \\end{vmatrix}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{31}) + a_{13}(a_{21}a_{32} - a_{22}a_{31}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Let’s extend this now to any \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. Let’s define \\({\\bf A}_{ij}\\) as the \\((n-1)\\times (n-1)\\) submatrix of \\({\\bf A}\\) obtained by deleting row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\). Let the \\((i,j)\\)th minor of \\({\\bf A}\\) be the determinant of \\({\\bf A}_{ij}\\): \\[M_{ij}=|{\\bf A}_{ij}|\\] Then for any \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\({\\bf A}\\) \\[|{\\bf A}|= a_{11}M_{11} - a_{12}M_{12} + \\cdots + (-1)^{n+1} a_{1n} M_{1n}\\] For example, in figuring out whether the following matrix has an inverse? \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;1&amp;1\\\\0&amp;2&amp;3\\\\5&amp;5&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] 1. Calculate its determinant. \\[\\begin{eqnarray} &amp;=&amp; 1(2-15) - 1(0-15) + 1(0-10) \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -13+15-10 \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; -8\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray}\\] 2. Since \\(|{\\bf A}|\\ne 0\\), we conclude that \\({\\bf A}\\) has an inverse. Exercise 7.10 (Determinants and Inverses) Determine whether the following matrices are nonsingular: \\[1. \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[2. \\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\end{pmatrix}\\] 7.11 Getting Inverse of a Matrix using its Determinant Thus far, we have a number of algorithms to Find the solution of a linear system, Find the inverse of a matrix but these remain just that — algorithms. At this point, we have no way of telling how the solutions \\(x_j\\) change as the parameters \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(b_i\\) change, except by changing the values and “rerunning” the algorithms. With determinants, we can provide an explicit formula for the inverse and therefore provide an explicit formula for the solution of an \\(n\\times n\\) linear system. Hence, we can examine how changes in the parameters and \\(b_i\\) affect the solutions \\(x_j\\). Determinant Formula for the Inverse of a \\(2 \\times 2\\): The determinant of a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix A \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\) is defined as: \\[\\frac{1}{\\det({\\bf A})} \\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b\\\\ -c &amp; a\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] For example, Let’s calculate the inverse of matrix A from Exercise 7.9 using the determinant formula. Recall, \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 &amp; 4\\\\ 2 &amp; -1\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\det({\\bf A}) = (-3)(-1) - (4)(2) = 3 - 8 = -5\\] \\[\\frac{1}{\\det({\\bf A})} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; -4\\\\ -2 &amp; -3\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[\\frac{1}{-5} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; -4\\\\ -2 &amp; -3\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} &amp; \\frac{4}{5}\\\\ \\frac{2}{5} &amp; \\frac{3}{5}\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Exercise 7.11 (Calculate Inverse using Determinant Formula) Caculate the inverse of A \\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 5\\\\ -7 &amp; 2\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Answers to Examples and Exercises Answer to Example 7.1: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;-3&amp;-3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) 6 + 4 + 10 = 20 Answer to Exercise 7.1: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp;4&amp;-7&amp;-5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp;26&amp;-14&amp;4&amp;30 \\end{pmatrix}\\) 63 -3 -10 + 24 = 74 undefined Answer to Example 7.2: yes no Answer to Exercise 7.2: yes no (\\(-v_1 -v_2 + v_3 = 0\\)) Answer to Example 7.3: \\({\\bf A+B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 \\\\ 6 &amp; 6 &amp; 8 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Answer to Example 7.4: \\(s {\\bf A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ 8 &amp; 10 &amp; 12 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Answer to Example ??: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} aA+bC&amp;aB+bD\\\\cA+dC&amp;cB+dD\\\\eA+fC&amp;eB+fD \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1(-2)+2(4)-1(2)&amp;1(5)+2(-3)-1(1)\\\\ 3(-2)+1(4)+4(2)&amp;3(5)+1(-3)+4(1)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4&amp;-2\\\\6&amp;16\\end{pmatrix}\\) Answer to Exercise 7.3: \\(AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp; 11 &amp; -15 \\\\ 5 &amp; 7 &amp; -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\) \\(BA =\\) undefined \\((BC)^T =\\) undefined \\(BC^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;5&amp;-7\\\\1&amp;1&amp;0\\\\0&amp;-1&amp;1\\\\2&amp;0&amp;0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 3&amp;0\\\\2&amp;4\\\\-1&amp;6 \\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix}20 &amp; -22 \\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\\\ -3 &amp;2 \\\\6 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\) Answer to Exercise 7.4: There are many answers to this.

Each observation is a respondent from the Afrobarometer survey. head(nunn_full) ## # A tibble: 6 × 59 ## respno ethni…¹ murdo…² isocode region distr…³ townv…⁴ locat…⁵ trust…⁶ trust…⁷ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 BEN0001 fon FON BEN atlna… KPOMAS… TOKPA-… 30 3 3 ## 2 BEN0002 fon FON BEN atlna… KPOMAS… TOKPA-… 30 3 3 ## 3 BEN0003 fon FON BEN atlna… OUIDAH 3ARROND 31 0 0 ## 4 BEN0004 fon FON BEN atlna… OUIDAH 3ARROND 31 0 0 ## 5 BEN0005 fon FON BEN atlna… OUIDAH PAHOU 32 1 1 ## 6 BEN0006 fon FON BEN atlna… OUIDAH PAHOU 32 1 1 ## # … with 49 more variables: intra_group_trust &lt;dbl&gt;, inter_group_trust &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # trust_local_council &lt;dbl&gt;, ln_export_area &lt;dbl&gt;, export_area &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # export_pop &lt;dbl&gt;, ln_export_pop &lt;dbl&gt;, age &lt;dbl&gt;, age2 &lt;dbl&gt;, male &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # urban_dum &lt;dbl&gt;, occupation &lt;dbl&gt;, religion &lt;dbl&gt;, living_conditions &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # education &lt;dbl&gt;, near_dist &lt;dbl&gt;, distsea &lt;dbl&gt;, loc_murdock_name &lt;chr&gt;, ## # loc_ln_export_area &lt;dbl&gt;, local_council_performance &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # council_listen &lt;dbl&gt;, corrupt_local_council &lt;dbl&gt;, school_present &lt;dbl&gt;, … ## # ℹ Use `colnames()` to see all variable names colnames(nunn_full) ## [1] &quot;respno&quot; &quot;ethnicity&quot; ## [3] &quot;murdock_name&quot; &quot;isocode&quot; ## [5] &quot;region&quot; &quot;district&quot; ## [7] &quot;townvill&quot; &quot;location_id&quot; ## [9] &quot;trust_relatives&quot; &quot;trust_neighbors&quot; ## [11] &quot;intra_group_trust&quot; &quot;inter_group_trust&quot; ## [13] &quot;trust_local_council&quot; &quot;ln_export_area&quot; ## [15] &quot;export_area&quot; &quot;export_pop&quot; ## [17] &quot;ln_export_pop&quot; &quot;age&quot; ## [19] &quot;age2&quot; &quot;male&quot; ## [21] &quot;urban_dum&quot; &quot;occupation&quot; ## [23] &quot;religion&quot; &quot;living_conditions&quot; ## [25] &quot;education&quot; &quot;near_dist&quot; ## [27] &quot;distsea&quot; &quot;loc_murdock_name&quot; ## [29] &quot;loc_ln_export_area&quot; &quot;local_council_performance&quot; ## [31] &quot;council_listen&quot; &quot;corrupt_local_council&quot; ## [33] &quot;school_present&quot; &quot;electricity_present&quot; ## [35] &quot;piped_water_present&quot; &quot;sewage_present&quot; ## [37] &quot;health_clinic_present&quot; &quot;district_ethnic_frac&quot; ## [39] &quot;frac_ethnicity_in_district&quot; &quot;townvill_nonethnic_mean_exports&quot; ## [41] &quot;district_nonethnic_mean_exports&quot; &quot;region_nonethnic_mean_exports&quot; ## [43] &quot;country_nonethnic_mean_exports&quot; &quot;murdock_centr_dist_coast&quot; ## [45] &quot;centroid_lat&quot; &quot;centroid_long&quot; ## [47] &quot;explorer_contact&quot; &quot;railway_contact&quot; ## [49] &quot;dist_Saharan_node&quot; &quot;dist_Saharan_line&quot; ## [51] &quot;malaria_ecology&quot; &quot;v30&quot; ## [53] &quot;v33&quot; &quot;fishing&quot; ## [55] &quot;exports&quot; &quot;ln_exports&quot; ## [57] &quot;total_missions_area&quot; &quot;ln_init_pop_density&quot; ## [59] &quot;cities_1400_dum&quot; First, let’s consider a small subset of this dataset. nunn &lt;- read_dta(&quot;data/input/Nunn_Wantchekon_sample.dta&quot;) nunn ## # A tibble: 10 × 5 ## trust_neighbors exports ln_exports export_area ln_export_area ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 0.388 0.328 0.00407 0.00406 ## 2 3 0.631 0.489 0.0971 0.0926 ## 3 3 0.994 0.690 0.0125 0.0124 ## 4 0 183. 5.21 1.82 1.04 ## 5 3 0 0 0 0 ## 6 2 0 0 0 0 ## 7 2 666. 6.50 14.0 2.71 ## 8 0 0.348 0.298 0.00608 0.00606 ## 9 3 0.435 0.361 0.0383 0.0376 ## 10 3 0 0 0 0 8.2 data.frame vs. matricies This is a data.frame object. class(nunn) ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; But it can be also consider a matrix in the linear algebra sense. What are the dimensions of this matrix? nrow(nunn) ## [1] 10 data.frames and matrices have much overlap in R, but to explicitly treat an object as a matrix, you’d need to coerce its class. Let’s call this matrix X. X &lt;- as.matrix(nunn) What is the difference between a data.frame and a matrix? A data.frame can have columns that are of different types, whereas — in a matrix — all columns must be of the same type (usually either “numeric” or “character”). You can think of data frames maybe as matrices-plus, because a column can take on characters as well as numbers. As we just saw, this is often useful for real data analyses. Another way to think about data frames is that it is a type of list. Try the str() code below and notice how it is organized in slots. Each slot is a vector. They can be vectors of numbers or characters. # enter this on your console str(cen10) 8.3 Handling matricies in R You can easily transpose a matrix X ## trust_neighbors exports ln_exports export_area ln_export_area ## [1,] 3 0.3883497 0.3281158 0.004067405 0.004059155 ## [2,] 3 0.6311236 0.4892691 0.097059444 0.092633367 ## [3,] 3 0.9941893 0.6902376 0.012524694 0.012446908 ## [4,] 0 182.5891266 5.2127004 1.824284434 1.038255095 ## [5,] 3 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 ## [6,] 2 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 ## [7,] 2 665.9652100 6.5027380 13.975566864 2.706419945 ## [8,] 0 0.3476418 0.2983562 0.006082553 0.006064130 ## [9,] 3 0.4349871 0.3611559 0.038332380 0.037615947 ## [10,] 3 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 t(X) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## trust_neighbors 3.000000000 3.00000000 3.00000000 0.000000 3 2 ## exports 0.388349682 0.63112360 0.99418926 182.589127 0 0 ## ln_exports 0.328115761 0.48926911 0.69023758 5.212700 0 0 ## export_area 0.004067405 0.09705944 0.01252469 1.824284 0 0 ## ln_export_area 0.004059155 0.09263337 0.01244691 1.038255 0 0 ## [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## trust_neighbors 2.000000 0.000000000 3.00000000 3 ## exports 665.965210 0.347641766 0.43498713 0 ## ln_exports 6.502738 0.298356235 0.36115587 0 ## export_area 13.975567 0.006082553 0.03833238 0 ## ln_export_area 2.706420 0.006064130 0.03761595 0 What are the values of all rows in the first column?

What is ln_exports? The article describes this as the natural log of one plus the exports. This is a transformation of one column by a particular function log(1 + X[, &quot;exports&quot;]) ## [1] 0.3281158 0.4892691 0.6902376 5.2127003 0.0000000 0.0000000 6.5027379 ## [8] 0.2983562 0.3611559 0.0000000 Question for you: why add the 1? Verify that this is the same as X[, \"ln_exports\"] 8.5 Linear Combinations In Table 1 we see “OLS Estimates”. These are estimates of OLS coefficients and standard errors. You do not need to know what these are for now, but it doesn’t hurt to getting used to seeing them. A very crude way to describe regression is through linear combinations. The simplest linear combination is a one-to-one transformation. Take the first number in Table 1, which is -0.00068. Now, multiply this by exports -0.00068 * X[, &quot;exports&quot;] ## [1] -0.0002640778 -0.0004291640 -0.0006760487 -0.1241606061 0.0000000000 ## [6] 0.0000000000 -0.4528563428 -0.0002363964 -0.0002957912 0.0000000000 Now, just one more step. Make a new matrix with just exports and the value 1 X2 &lt;- cbind(1, X[, &quot;exports&quot;]) name this new column “intercept” colnames(X2) ## NULL colnames(X2) &lt;- c(&quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;exports&quot;) What are the dimensions of the matrix X2? dim(X2) ## [1] 10 2 Now consider a new matrix, called B.

The first is for the study of calculus, which will be in turn useful to show where certain functions are maximized or minimized. The second is for the study of statistical inference, which is the study of inferring things about things you cannot see by using things you can see. Example: The Central Limit Theorem Perhaps the most important theorem in statistics is the Central Limit Theorem, Theorem 9.1 (Central Limit Theorem (i.i.d. case)) For any series of independent and identically distributed random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\cdots\\), we know the distribution of its sum even if we do not know the distribution of \\(X\\). The distribution of the sum is a Normal distribution. \\[\\frac{\\bar{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\xrightarrow{d} \\text{Normal}(0, 1),\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of \\(X\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of \\(X\\). The arrow is read as “converges in distribution to”. \\(\\text{Normal}(0, 1)\\) indicates a Normal Distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. That is, the limit of the distribution of the lefthand side is the distribution of the righthand side. The sign of a limit is the arrow “\\(\\rightarrow\\)”. Although we have not yet covered probability (in Section 13) so we have not described what distributions and random variables are, it is worth foreshadowing the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem is powerful because it gives us a guarantee of what would happen if \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), which in this case means we collected more data. Example: The Law of Large Numbers A finding that perhaps rivals the Central Limit Theorem is the Law of Large Numbers: Theorem 9.2 ((Weak) Law of Large Numbers) For any draw of identically distributed independent variables with mean \\(\\mu\\), the sample average after \\(n\\) draws, \\(\\bar{X}_n\\), converges in probability to the true mean as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\): \\[\\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty} P(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu | &gt; \\varepsilon) = 0\\] A shorthand of which is \\(\\bar{X}_n \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu\\), where the arrow is read as “converges in probability to”. Intuitively, the more data, the more accurate is your guess. For example, the Figure 9.1 shows how the sample average from many coin tosses converges to the true value : 0.5. Figure 9.1: As the number of coin tosses goes to infinity, the average probabiity of heads converges to 0.5 9.1 Sequences We need a couple of steps until we get to limit theorems in probability. First we will introduce a “sequence”, then we will think about the limit of a sequence, then we will think about the limit of a function. A sequence \\[\\{x_n\\}=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\] is an ordered set of real numbers, where \\(x_1\\) is the first term in the sequence and \\(y_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th term. Generally, a sequence is infinite, that is it extends to \\(n=\\infty\\). We can also write the sequence as \\[\\{x_n\\}^\\infty_{n=1}\\] where the subscript and superscript are read together as “from 1 to infinity.” Example 9.1 (Sequences) How do these sequences behave? \\(\\{A_n\\}=\\left\\{ 2-\\frac{1}{n^2} \\right\\}\\) \\(\\{B_n\\}=\\left\\{\\frac{n^2+1}{n} \\right\\}\\) \\(\\{C_n\\}=\\left\\{(-1)^n \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\right\\}\\) We find the sequence by simply “plugging in” the integers into each \\(n\\). The important thing is to get a sense of how these numbers are going to change. Example 1’s numbers seem to come closer and closer to 2, but will it ever surpass 2? Example 2’s numbers are also increasing each time, but will it hit a limit? What is the pattern in Example 3? Graphing helps you make this point more clearly. See the sequence of \\(n = 1, ...20\\) for each of the three examples in Figure 9.2. Figure 9.2: Behavior of Some Sequences 9.2 The Limit of a Sequence The notion of “converging to a limit” is the behavior of the points in Example 9.1. In some sense, that’s the counterfactual we want to know. What happens as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)? Sequences like 1 above that converge to a limit. Sequences like 2 above that increase without bound. Sequences like 3 above that neither converge nor increase without bound — alternating over the number line. Definition 9.1 The sequence \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) has the limit \\(L\\), which we write as \\[\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n =L\\], if for any \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) there is an integer \\(N\\) (which depends on \\(\\epsilon\\)) with the property that \\(|y_n -L|&lt;\\epsilon\\) for each \\(n&gt;N\\). \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) is said to converge to \\(L\\). If the above does not hold, then \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) diverges. We can also express the behavior of a sequence as bounded or not: Bounded: if \\(|y_n|\\le K\\) for all \\(n\\) Monotonically Increasing: \\(y_{n+1}&gt;y_n\\) for all \\(n\\) Monotonically Decreasing: \\(y_{n+1}&lt;y_n\\) for all \\(n\\) A limit is unique: If \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) converges, then the limit \\(L\\) is unique. If a sequence converges, then the sum of such sequences also converges. Let \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n = y\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} z_n =z\\). Then \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} [k y_n + \\ell z_n]= k y + \\ell z\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n z_n = yz\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n} = \\frac{y}{z}\\), provided \\(z\\neq 0\\) This looks reasonable enough. The harder question, obviously is when the parts of the fraction don’t converge. If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = \\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} z_n = \\infty\\), What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n - z_n\\)? What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n}\\)? It is nice for a sequence to converge in limit. We want to know if complex-looking sequences converge or not. The name of the game here is to break that complex sequence up into sums of simple fractions where \\(n\\) only appears in the denominator: \\(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), and so on. Each of these will converge to 0, because the denominator gets larger and larger. Then, because of the properties above, we can then find the final sequence. Example 9.2 (Simplifying a Fraction into Sums) Find the limit of \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n},\\] Solution. At first glance, \\(n + 3\\) and \\(n\\) both grow to \\(\\infty\\), so it looks like we need to divide infinity by infinity. However, we can express this fraction as a sum, then the limits apply separately: \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n} = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{n}\\right) = \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}1}_{1} + \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)}_{0}\\] so, the limit is actually 1. After some practice, the key to intuition is whether one part of the fraction grows “faster” than another. If the denominator grows faster to infinity than the numerator, then the fraction will converge to 0, even if the numerator will also increase to infinity. In a sense, limits show how not all infinities are the same. Exercise 9.1 Find the following limits of sequences, then explain in English the intuition for why that is the case. \\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{2n}{n^2 + 1}\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (n^3 - 100n^2)\\) 9.3 Limits of a Function We’ve now covered functions and just covered limits of sequences, so now is the time to combine the two. A function \\(f\\) is a compact representation of some behavior we care about. Like for sequences, we often want to know if \\(f(x)\\) approaches some number \\(L\\) as its independent variable \\(x\\) moves to some number \\(c\\) (which is usually 0 or \\(\\pm\\infty\\)). If it does, we say that the limit of \\(f(x)\\), as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\), is \\(L\\): \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=L\\). Unlike a sequence, \\(x\\) is a continuous number, and we can move in decreasing order as well as increasing. For a limit \\(L\\) to exist, the function \\(f(x)\\) must approach \\(L\\) from both the left (increasing) and the right (decreasing). Definition 9.2 (Limit of a function) Let \\(f(x)\\) be defined at each point in some open interval containing the point \\(c\\). Then \\(L\\) equals \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\) if for any (small positive) number \\(\\epsilon\\), there exists a corresponding number \\(\\delta&gt;0\\) such that if \\(0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\\delta\\), then \\(|f(x)-L|&lt;\\epsilon\\). A neat, if subtle result is that \\(f(x)\\) does not necessarily have to be defined at \\(c\\) for \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}\\) to exist. Properties: Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be functions with \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=k\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)=\\ell\\). \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}[f(x)+g(x)]=\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)+ \\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} kf(x) = k\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x) g(x) = \\left[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\right]\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)}{\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)}\\), provided \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} g(x)\\ne 0\\). Simple limits of functions can be solved as we did limits of sequences. Just be careful which part of the function is changing. Example 9.3 (Limits of Functions) Find the limit of the following functions. \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} k\\) \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} x\\) \\(\\lim_{x\\to 2} (2x-3)\\) \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} x^n\\) Limits can get more complex in roughly two ways. First, the functions may become large polynomials with many moving pieces. Second,the functions may become discontinuous. The function can be thought of as a more general or “smooth” version of sequences. For example, Exercise 9.2 (Limits of a Fraction of Functions) Find the limit of \\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(x^4 +3x−99)(2−x^5)}{(18x^7 +9x^6 −3x^2 −1)(x+1)}\\] Now, the functions will become a bit more complex: Exercise 9.3 Solve the following limits of functions \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} |x|\\) \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)\\) So there are a few more alternatives about what a limit of a function could be: Right-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from right to left. Left-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from left to right. Infinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely large. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\). Negative infinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely negative. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\). The distinction between left and right becomes important when the function is not determined for some values of \\(x\\). What are those cases in the examples below? Figure 9.3: Functions which are not defined in some areas 9.4 Continuity To repeat a finding from the limits of functions: \\(f(x)\\) does not necessarily have to be defined at \\(c\\) for \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c}\\) to exist. Functions that have breaks in their lines are called discontinuous. Functions that have no breaks are called continuous. Continuity is a concept that is more fundamental to, but related to that of “differentiability”, which we will cover next in calculus. Definition 9.3 (Continuity) Suppose that the domain of the function \\(f\\) includes an open interval containing the point \\(c\\). Then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\) exists and if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=f(c)\\). Further, \\(f\\) is continuous on an open interval \\((a,b)\\) if it is continuous at each point in the interval. To prove that a function is continuous for all points is beyond this practical introduction to math, but the general intuition can be grasped by graphing. Example 9.4 (Continuous and Discontinuous Functions) For each function, determine if it is continuous or discontinuous. \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) \\(f(x) = e^x\\) \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\(f(x) = \\text{floor}(x)\\). The floor is the smaller of the two integers bounding a number. So \\(\\text{floor}(x = 2.999) = 2\\), \\(\\text{floor}(x = 2.0001) = 2\\), and \\(\\text{floor}(x = 2) = 2.\\) Solution. In Figure 9.4, we can see that the first two functions are continuous, and the next two are discontinuous. \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) is discontinuous at \\(x= 0\\), and \\(f(x) = \\text{floor}(x)\\) is discontinuous at each whole number. Figure 9.4: Continuous and Discontinuous Functions Some properties of continuous functions: If \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous at point \\(c\\), then \\(f+g\\), \\(f-g\\), \\(f \\cdot g\\), \\(|f|\\), and \\(\\alpha f\\) are continuous at point \\(c\\) also. \\(f/g\\) is continuous, provided \\(g(c)\\ne 0\\). Boundedness: If \\(f\\) is continuous on the closed bounded interval \\([a,b]\\), then there is a number \\(K\\) such that \\(|f(x)|\\le K\\) for each \\(x\\) in \\([a,b]\\). Max/Min: If \\(f\\) is continuous on the closed bounded interval \\([a,b]\\), then \\(f\\) has a maximum and a minimum on \\([a,b]\\). They may be located at the end points. Exercise 9.4 (Limit when Denominator converges to 0) Let \\[f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x}{x}.\\] Graph the function. Is it defined everywhere? What is the functions limit at \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\)?

Although this function seems large, the thing our eyes should focus on is where the highest order polynomial remains. That will grow the fastest, so if the highest order term is on the denominator, the fraction will converge to 0, if it is on the numerator it will converge to negative infinity. Previewing the multiplication by hand, we can see that the \\(-x^9\\) on the numerator will be the largest power. So the answer will be \\(-\\infty\\). We can also confirm this by writing out fractions: \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{3}{x^3} - \\frac{99}{4x^4}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2}{x^5} + 1\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{9}{18x} - \\frac{3}{18x^5} - \\frac{1}{18x^7} \\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)} \\\\ &amp;\\times \\frac{x^4}{1} \\times -\\frac{x^5}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{18x^7}\\times \\frac{1}{x}\\\\ =&amp; 1 \\times \\lim_{-x\\to\\infty} \\frac{x}{18} \\end{align*}\\] Exercise 9.4 Solution. See Figure 9.5. We can say \\(\\lim_{x\\to 0}f(x) = 2\\). Note that we can express \\[f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} x+2 &amp; x \\neq 2; \\\\ \\mbox{undefined} &amp; x = 2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Figure 9.5: A function undedefined at x = 0 "],["derivatives.html", "Chapter 10 Differential Calculus 10.1 Derivatives 10.2 Higher-Order Derivatives 10.3 The Chain Rule 10.4 Derivatives of logs and exponents 10.5 Partial Derivatives 10.6 Taylor Approximation", " Chapter 10 Differential Calculus Calculus is a fundamental part of any type of statistics exercise. Although you may not be taking derivatives and integral in your daily work as an analyst, calculus undergirds many concepts we use: maximization, expectation, and cumulative probability. 10.1 Derivatives The derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) is its rate of change at \\(x\\): how much \\(f(x)\\) changes with a change in \\(x\\). The rate of change is a fraction — rise over run — but because not all lines are straight and the rise over run formula will give us different values depending on the range we examine, we need to take a limit (Section 9). Definition 10.1 (Derivative) Let \\(f\\) be a function whose domain includes an open interval containing the point \\(x\\). The derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) is given by \\[\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) =\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x} = \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\] There are a two main ways to denote a derivate: Leibniz Notation: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\) Prime or Lagrange Notation: \\(f&#39;(x)\\) If \\(f(x)\\) is a straight line, the derivative is the slope. For a curve, the slope changes by the values of \\(x\\), so the derivative is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at \\(x\\). See, For example, Figure 10.1. Figure 10.1: The Derivative as a Slope If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) exists at a point \\(x_0\\), then \\(f\\) is said to be differentiable at \\(x_0\\). That also implies that \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x_0\\). Properties of derivatives Suppose that \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are differentiable at \\(x\\) and that \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant. Then the functions \\(f\\pm g\\), \\(\\alpha f\\), \\(f g\\), and \\(f/g\\) (provided \\(g(x)\\ne 0\\)) are also differentiable at \\(x\\). Additionally, Constant rule: \\[\\left[k f(x)\\right]&#39; = k f&#39;(x)\\] Sum rule: \\[\\left[f(x)\\pm g(x)\\right]&#39; = f&#39;(x)\\pm g&#39;(x)\\] With a bit more algebra, we can apply the definition of derivatives to get a formula for of the derivative of a product and a derivative of a quotient. Product rule: \\[\\left[f(x)g(x)\\right]^\\prime = f^\\prime(x)g(x)+f(x)g^\\prime(x)\\] Quotient rule: \\[\\left[f(x)/g(x)\\right]^\\prime = \\frac{f^\\prime(x)g(x) - f(x)g^\\prime(x)}{[g(x)]^2}, ~g(x)\\neq 0\\] Finally, one way to think of the power of derivatives is that it takes a function a notch down in complexity. The power rule applies to any higher-order function: Power rule: \\[\\left[x^k\\right]^\\prime = k x^{k-1}\\] For any real number \\(k\\) (that is, both whole numbers and fractions). The power rule is proved by induction, a neat method of proof used in many fundamental applications to prove that a general statement holds for every possible case, even if there are countably infinite cases. We’ll show a simple case where \\(k\\) is an integer here. Proof (Proof of Power Rule by Induction). We would like to prove that \\[\\left[x^k\\right]^\\prime = k x^{k-1}\\] for any integer \\(k\\). First, consider the first case (the base case) of \\(k = 1\\). We can show by the definition of derivatives (setting \\(f(x) = x^1 = 1\\)) that \\[[x^1]^\\prime = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{(x + h) - x}{(x + h) - x}= 1.\\] Because \\(1\\) is also expressed as \\(1 x^{1- 1}\\), the statement we want to prove holds for the case \\(k =1\\). Now, that the statement holds for some integer \\(m\\). That is, assume \\[\\left[x^m\\right]^\\prime = m x^{m-1}\\] Then, for the case \\(m + 1\\), using the product rule above, we can simplify \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[x^{m + 1}\\right]^\\prime &amp;= [x^{m}\\cdot x]^\\prime\\\\ &amp;= (x^m)^\\prime\\cdot x + (x^m)\\cdot (x)^\\prime\\\\ &amp;= m x^{m - 1}\\cdot x + x^m ~~\\because \\text{by previous assumption}\\\\ &amp;= mx^m + x^m\\\\ &amp;= (m + 1)x^m\\\\ &amp;= (m + 1)x^{(m + 1) - 1} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the rule holds for the case \\(k = m + 1\\) once we have assumed it holds for \\(k = m\\). Combined with the first case, this completes proof by induction – we have now proved that the statement holds for all integers \\(k = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots\\). To show that it holds for real fractions as well, we can prove expressing that exponent by a fraction of two integers. These “rules” become apparent by applying the definition of the derivative above to each of the things to be “derived”, but these come up so frequently that it is best to repeat until it is muscle memory. Exercise 10.1 (Derivative of Polynomials) For each of the following functions, find the first-order derivative \\(f^\\prime(x)\\). \\(f(x)=c\\) \\(f(x)=x\\) \\(f(x)=x^2\\) \\(f(x)=x^3\\) \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\(f(x)=(x^3)(2x^4)\\) \\(f(x) = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1\\) \\(f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x^3 - 1)\\) \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x^{1/3}\\) \\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2+1}{x^2-1}\\) 10.2 Higher-Order Derivatives The first derivative is applying the definition of derivatives on the function, and it can be expressed as \\[f&#39;(x), ~~ y&#39;, ~~ \\frac{d}{dx}f(x), ~~ \\frac{dy}{dx}\\] We can keep applying the differentiation process to functions that are themselves derivatives. The derivative of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), would then be \\[f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f&#39;(x+h)-f&#39;(x)}{h}\\] and we can therefore call it the Second derivative: \\[f&#39;&#39;(x), ~~ y&#39;&#39;, ~~ \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x), ~~ \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\] Similarly, the derivative of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) would be called the third derivative and is denoted \\(f&#39;&#39;&#39;(x)\\). And by extension, the nth derivative is expressed as \\(\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)\\), \\(\\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}\\). Example 10.1 (Succession of Derivatives) \\[\\begin{align*} f(x) &amp;=x^3\\\\ f^{\\prime}(x) &amp;=3x^2\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}(x) &amp;=6x \\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) &amp;=6\\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) &amp;=0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Earlier, in Section 10.1, we said that if a function differentiable at a given point, then it must be continuous. Further, if \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is itself continuous, then \\(f(x)\\) is called continuously differentiable. All of this matters because many of our findings about optimization (Section 11) rely on differentiation, and so we want our function to be differentiable in as many layers. A function that is continuously differentiable infinitly is called “smooth”. Some examples: \\(f(x) = x^2\\), \\(f(x) = e^x\\). 10.3 The Chain Rule As useful as the above rules are, many functions you’ll see won’t fit neatly in each case immediately. Instead, they will be functions of functions. For example, the difference between \\(x^2 + 1^2\\) and \\((x^2 + 1)^2\\) may look trivial, but the sum rule can be easily applied to the former, while it’s actually not obvious what do with the latter. Composite functions are formed by substituting one function into another and are denoted by \\[(f\\circ g)(x)=f[g(x)].\\] To form \\(f[g(x)]\\), the range of \\(g\\) must be contained (at least in part) within the domain of \\(f\\). The domain of \\(f\\circ g\\) consists of all the points in the domain of \\(g\\) for which \\(g(x)\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\). Example 10.2 Let \\(f(x)=\\ln x\\) for \\(0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\) and \\(g(x)=x^2\\) for \\(-\\infty&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\). Then \\[(f\\circ g)(x)=\\ln x^2, -\\infty&lt;x&lt;\\infty - \\{0\\}\\] Also \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=[\\ln x]^2, 0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\] Notice that \\(f\\circ g\\) and \\(g\\circ f\\) are not the same functions. With the notation of composite functions in place, now we can introduce a helpful additional rule that will deal with a derivative of composite functions as a chain of concentric derivatives. Chain Rule: Let \\(y=(f\\circ g)(x)= f[g(x)]\\). The derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\{ f[g(x)] \\} = f&#39;[g(x)] g&#39;(x)\\] We can read this as: “the derivative of the composite function \\(y\\) is the derivative of \\(f\\) evaluated at \\(g(x)\\), times the derivative of \\(g\\).” The chain rule can be thought of as the derivative of the “outside” times the derivative of the “inside”, remembering that the derivative of the outside function is evaluated at the value of the inside function. The chain rule can also be written as \\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{dg(x)} \\frac{dg(x)}{dx}\\] This expression does not imply that the \\(dg(x)\\)’s cancel out, as in fractions. They are part of the derivative notation and you can’t separate them out or cancel them.) Example 10.3 (Composite Exponent) Find \\(f^\\prime(x)\\) for \\(f(x) = (3x^2+5x-7)^6\\). The direct use of a chain rule is when the exponent of is itself a function, so the power rule could not have applied generaly: Generalized Power Rule: If \\(f(x)=[g(x)]^p\\) for any rational number \\(p\\), \\[f^\\prime(x) =p[g(x)]^{p-1}g^\\prime(x)\\] 10.4 Derivatives of logs and exponents Natural logs and exponents (they are inverses of each other; see Section 1.3) crop up everywhere in statistics. Their derivative is a special case from the above, but quite elegant. Theorem 10.1 The functions \\(e^x\\) and the natural logarithm \\(\\ln(x)\\) are continuous and differentiable in their domains, and their first derivate is \\[(e^x)^\\prime = e^x\\] \\[\\ln(x)^\\prime = \\frac{1}{x}\\] Also, when these are composite functions, it follows by the generalized power rule that \\[\\left(e^{g(x)}\\right)^\\prime = e^{g(x)} \\cdot g^\\prime(x)\\] \\[\\left(\\ln g(x)\\right)^\\prime = \\frac{g^\\prime(x)}{g(x)}, ~~\\text{if}~~ g(x) &gt; 0\\] We will relegate the proofs to small excerpts. Derivatives of exponents To repeat the main rule in Theorem 10.1, the intuition is that Derivative of \\(e^x\\) is itself: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x\\) (See Figure 10.2) Same thing if there were a constant in front: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\alpha e^x = \\alpha e^x\\) Same thing no matter how many derivatives there are in front: \\(\\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \\alpha e^x = \\alpha e^x\\) Chain Rule: When the exponent is a function of \\(x\\), remember to take derivative of that function and add to product. \\(\\frac{d}{dx}e^{g(x)}= e^{g(x)} g^\\prime(x)\\) Figure 10.2: Derivative of the Exponential Function Example 10.4 (Derivative of exponents) Find the derivative for the following. \\(f(x)=e^{-3x}\\) \\(f(x)=e^{x^2}\\) \\(f(x)=(x-1)e^x\\) Derivatives of logs The natural log is the mirror image of the natural exponent and has mirroring properties, again, to repeat the theorem, log prime x is one over x: \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln x = \\frac{1}{x}\\) (Figure 10.3) Exponents become multiplicative constants: \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln x^k = \\frac{d}{dx} k \\ln x = \\frac{k}{x}\\) Chain rule again: \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln u(x) = \\frac{u&#39;(x)}{u(x)}\\quad\\) For any positive base \\(b\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dx} b^x = (\\ln b)\\left(b^x\\right)\\). Figure 10.3: Derivative of the Natural Log Example 10.5 (Derivative of logs) Find \\(dy/dx\\) for the following. \\(f(x)=\\ln(x^2+9)\\) \\(f(x)=\\ln(\\ln x)\\) \\(f(x)=(\\ln x)^2\\) \\(f(x)=\\ln e^x\\) Outline of Proof We actually show the derivative of the log first, and then the derivative of the exponential naturally follows. The general derivative of the log at any base \\(a\\) is solvable by the definition of derivatives. \\[\\begin{align*} (\\ln_a x)^\\prime = \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{1}{h}\\ln_{a}\\left(1 + \\frac{h}{x}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Re-express \\(g = \\frac{h}{x}\\) and get \\[\\begin{align*} (\\ln_a x)^\\prime &amp;= \\frac{1}{x}\\lim_{g\\to 0}\\ln_{a} (1 + g)^{\\frac{1}{g}}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{x}\\ln_a e \\end{align*}\\] By definition of \\(e\\). As a special case, when \\(a = e\\), then \\((\\ln x)^\\prime = \\frac{1}{x}\\). Now let’s think about the inverse, taking the derivative of \\(y = a^x\\). \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp;= a^x \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\ln y &amp;= x \\ln a\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\frac{y^\\prime}{y} &amp;= \\ln a\\\\ \\Rightarrow y^\\prime = y \\ln a\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Then in the special case where \\(a = e\\), \\[(e^x)^\\prime = (e^x)\\] 10.5 Partial Derivatives What happens when there’s more than variable that is changing? If you can do ordinary derivatives, you can do partial derivatives: just hold all the other input variables constant except for the one you’re differentiating with respect to. (Joe Blitzstein’s Math Notes) Suppose we have a function \\(f\\) now of two (or more) variables and we want to determine the rate of change relative to one of the variables. To do so, we would find its partial derivative, which is defined similar to the derivative of a function of one variable. Partial Derivative: Let \\(f\\) be a function of the variables \\((x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\). The partial derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x_i\\) is \\[\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} (x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x_1,\\ldots,x_i+h,\\ldots,x_n)-f(x_1,\\ldots,x_i,\\ldots,x_n)}{h}\\] Only the \\(i\\)th variable changes — the others are treated as constants. We can take higher-order partial derivatives, like we did with functions of a single variable, except now the higher-order partials can be with respect to multiple variables. Example 10.6 (More than one type of partial) Notice that you can take partials with regard to different variables. Suppose \\(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= \\end{align*}\\] Exercise 10.2 Let \\(f(x,y)=x^3 y^4 +e^x -\\ln y\\). What are the following partial derivaitves? \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x,y) &amp;=\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,y) &amp;= \\end{align*}\\] 10.6 Taylor Approximation A common form of approximation used in statistics involves derivatives. A Taylor series is a way to represent common functions as infinite series (a sum of infinite elements) of the function’s derivatives at some point \\(a\\). For example, Taylor series are very helpful in representing nonlinear (read: difficult) functions as linear (read: manageable) functions. One can thus approximate functions by using lower-order, finite series known as Taylor polynomials. If \\(a=0\\), the series is called a Maclaurin series. Specifically, a Taylor series of a real or complex function \\(f(x)\\) that is infinitely differentiable in the neighborhood of point \\(a\\) is: \\[\\begin{align*} f(x) &amp;= f(a) + \\frac{f&#39;(a)}{1!} (x-a) + \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2 + \\cdots\\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)} (a)}{n!} (x-a)^n \\end{align*}\\] Taylor Approximation: We can often approximate the curvature of a function \\(f(x)\\) at point \\(a\\) using a 2nd order Taylor polynomial around point \\(a\\): \\[f(x) = f(a) + \\frac{f&#39;(a)}{1!} (x-a) + \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2 + R_2\\] \\(R_2\\) is the remainder (R for remainder, 2 for the fact that we took two derivatives) and often treated as negligible, giving us: \\[f(x) \\approx f(a) + f&#39;(a)(x-a) + \\dfrac{f&#39;&#39;(a)}{2} (x-a)^2\\] The more derivatives that are added, the smaller the remainder \\(R\\) and the more accurate the approximation. Proofs involving limits guarantee that the remainder converges to 0 as the order of derivation increases. "],["optim.html", "Chapter 11 Optimization 11.1 Maxima and Minima 11.2 Concavity of a Function 11.3 Gradient and FOC 11.4 Hessian and SOC 11.5 Global Maxima and Minima", " Chapter 11 Optimization To optimize, we use derivatives and calculus. Optimization is to find the maximum or minimum of a functon, and to find what value of an input gives that extremum. This has obvious uses in engineering. Many tools in the statistical toolkit use optimization. One of the most common ways of estimating a model is through “Maximum Likelihood Estimation”, done via optimizing a function (the likelihood). Optimization also comes up in Economics, Formal Theory, and Political Economy all the time. A go-to model of human behavior is that they optimize a certain utility function. Humans are not pure utility maximizers, of course, but nuanced models of optimization – for example, adding constraints and adding uncertainty – will prove to be quite useful. 11.1 Maxima and Minima The first derivative, \\(f&#39;(x)\\), quantifies the slope of a function. Therefore, it can be used to check whether the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\(x\\) is increasing or decreasing at \\(x\\). Increasing: \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) Decreasing: \\(f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) Neither increasing nor decreasing: \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) i.e. a maximum, minimum, or saddle point So for example, \\(f(x) = x^2 + 2\\) and \\(f^\\prime(x) = 2x\\) Figure 11.1: Maxima and Minima Exercise 11.1 (Plotting a mazimum and minimum) Plot \\(f(x)=x^3+ x^2 + 2\\), plot its derivative, and identifiy where the derivative is zero. Is there a maximum or minimum? The second derivative \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) identifies whether the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\(x\\) is Concave / concave down: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) Convex / Concave up: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) Maximum (Minimum): \\(x_0\\) is a local maximum (minimum) if \\(f(x_0)&gt;f(x)\\) (\\(f(x_0)&lt;f(x))\\) for all \\(x\\) within some open interval containing \\(x_0\\). \\(x_0\\) is a global maximum (minimum) if \\(f(x_0)&gt;f(x)\\) (\\(f(x_0)&lt;f(x))\\) for all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\(f\\). Given the function \\(f\\) defined over domain \\(D\\), all of the following are defined as critical points: Any interior point of \\(D\\) where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\). Any interior point of \\(D\\) where \\(f&#39;(x)\\) does not exist. Any endpoint that is in \\(D\\). The maxima and minima will be a subset of the critical points. Second Derivative Test of Maxima/Minima: We can use the second derivative to tell us whether a point is a maximum or minimum of \\(f(x)\\). Local Maximum: \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) Local Minimum: \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) Need more info: \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\) Global Maxima and Minima Sometimes no global max or min exists — e.g., \\(f(x)\\) not bounded above or below. However, there are three situations where we can fairly easily identify global max or min. Functions with only one critical point. If \\(x_0\\) is a local max or min of \\(f\\) and it is the only critical point, then it is the global max or min. Globally concave up or concave down functions. If \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) is never zero, then there is at most one critical point. That critical point is a global maximum if \\(f&#39;&#39;&lt;0\\) and a global minimum if \\(f&#39;&#39;&gt;0\\). Functions over closed and bounded intervals must have both a global maximum and a global minimum. Example 11.1 (Maxima and Minima by drawing) Find any critical points and identify whether they are a max, min, or saddle point: \\(f(x)=x^2+2\\) \\(f(x)=x^3+2\\) \\(f(x)=|x^2-1|\\), \\(x\\in [-2,2]\\) 11.2 Concavity of a Function Concavity helps identify the curvature of a function, \\(f(x)\\), in 2 dimensional space. Definition 11.1 (Concave Function) A function \\(f\\) is strictly concave over the set S \\(\\forall x_1,x_2 \\in S\\) and \\(\\forall a \\in (0,1)\\), \\[f(ax_1 + (1-a)x_2) &gt; af(x_1) + (1-a)f(x_2)\\] line connecting two points on a concave function will lie the function. Definition 11.2 (Convex Function) Convex: A function f is strictly convex over the set S \\(\\forall x_1,x_2 \\in S\\) and \\(\\forall a \\in (0,1)\\), \\[f(ax_1 + (1-a)x_2) &lt; af(x_1) + (1-a)f(x_2)\\] Any line connecting two points on a convex function will lie above the function. Second Derivative Test of Concavity: The second derivative can be used to understand concavity. If \\[\\begin{array}{lll} f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0 &amp; \\Rightarrow &amp; \\text{Concave}\\\\ f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0 &amp; \\Rightarrow &amp; \\text{Convex} \\end{array}\\] Quadratic Forms Quadratic forms is shorthand for a way to summarize a function. This is important for finding concavity because Approximates local curvature around a point — e.g., used to identify max vs min vs saddle point. They are simple to express even in \\(n\\) dimensions: Have a matrix representation. Quadratic Form: A polynomial where each term is a monomial of degree 2 in any number of variables: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{One variable: }&amp; Q(x_1) = a_{11}x_1^2\\\\ \\text{Two variables: }&amp; Q(x_1,x_2) = a_{11}x_1^2 + a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{22}x_2^2\\\\ \\text{N variables: }&amp; Q(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)=\\sum\\limits_{i\\le j} a_{ij}x_i x_j \\end{align*}\\] which can be written in matrix terms: One variable \\[Q(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1^\\top a_{11} x_1\\] N variables: \\[\\begin{align*} Q(\\mathbf{x}) &amp;=\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_n \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}&amp;\\frac{1}{2}a_{12}&amp;\\cdots&amp;\\frac{1}{2}a_{1n}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}a_{12}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\\cdots&amp;\\frac{1}{2}a_{2n}\\\\ \\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\ddots&amp;\\vdots\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}a_{1n}&amp;\\frac{1}{2}a_{2n}&amp;\\cdots&amp;a_{nn} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\x_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\x_n\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{Ax} \\end{align*}\\] For example, the Quadratic on \\(\\mathbf{R}^2\\): \\[\\begin{align*} Q(x_1,x_2)&amp;=\\begin{pmatrix} x_1&amp; x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}&amp;\\frac{1}{2} a_{12}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}a_{12}&amp;a_{22}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &amp;= a_{11}x_1^2 + a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{22}x_2^2 \\end{align*}\\] Definiteness of Quadratic Forms When the function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) has more than two inputs, determining whether it has a maxima and minima (remember, functions may have many inputs but they have only one output) is a bit more tedious. Definiteness helps identify the curvature of a function, \\(Q(\\textbf{x})\\), in n dimensional space. Definiteness: By definition, a quadratic form always takes on the value of zero when \\(x = 0\\), \\(Q(\\textbf{x})=0\\) at \\(\\textbf{x}=0\\). The definiteness of the matrix \\(\\textbf{A}\\) is determined by whether the quadratic form \\(Q(\\textbf{x})=\\textbf{x}^\\top\\textbf{A}\\textbf{x}\\) is greater than zero, less than zero, or sometimes both over all \\(\\mathbf{x}\\ne 0\\). 11.3 Gradient and FOC We can see from a graphical representation that if a point is a local maxima or minima, it must meet certain conditions regarding its derivative. These are so commonly used that we refer these to “First Order Conditions” (FOCs) and “Second Order Conditions” (SOCs) in the economic tradition. When we examined functions of one variable \\(x\\), we found critical points by taking the first derivative, setting it to zero, and solving for \\(x\\). For functions of \\(n\\) variables, the critical points are found in much the same way, except now we set the partial derivatives equal to zero. Note: We will only consider critical points on the interior of a function’s domain. In a derivative, we only took the derivative with respect to one variable at a time. When we take the derivative separately with respect to all variables in the elements of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and then express the result as a vector, we use the term Gradient and Hessian. Definition 11.3 (Gradient) Given a function \\(f(\\textbf{x})\\) in \\(n\\) variables, the gradient \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\) (the greek letter nabla ) is a row vector, where the \\(i\\)th element is the partial derivative of \\(f(\\textbf{x})\\) with respect to \\(x_i\\): \\[\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n} \\end{pmatrix} \\] The gradient points in the direction of the steepest rate of increase at each point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Before we know whether a point is a maxima or minima, if it meets the FOC it is a “Critical Point”. Definition 11.4 (Critical Point) \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a critical point if and only if \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=\\mathbf{0}\\) (the vector of zeros). If the partial derivative of f(x) with respect to \\(x^*\\) is 0, then \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a critical point. To solve for \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), find the gradient, set each element equal to 0, and solve the system of equations. \\[\\mathbf{x}^* = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1^*\\\\x_2^*\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n^*\\end{pmatrix}\\] Example 11.2 Example: Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=(x_1-1)^2+x_2^2+1\\), find the (1) Gradient and (2) Critical point of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\). Solution. Gradient \\[\\begin{align*} \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1} &amp; \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(x_1-1) &amp; 2x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align*}\\] Critical Point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\): \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;\\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1} = 2(x_1-1) = 0 &amp; \\Rightarrow x_1^* = 1\\\\ &amp;\\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2} = 2x_2 = 0 &amp; \\Rightarrow x_2^* = 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] So \\[\\mathbf{x}^* = (1,0)\\] 11.4 Hessian and SOC When we found a critical point for a function of one variable, we used the second derivative as a indicator of the curvature at the point in order to determine whether the point was a min, max, or saddle (second derivative test of concavity). For functions of \\(n\\) variables, we use second order partial derivatives as an indicator of curvature. Definition 11.5 (Hessian) Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) in \\(n\\) variables, the hessian \\(\\mathbf{H(x)}\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, where the \\((i,j)\\)th element is the second order partial derivative of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) with respect to \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\): \\[\\mathbf{H(x)}=\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1^2}&amp;\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2}&amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_n}\\\\[9pt] \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1}&amp;\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2^2}&amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_n}\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\[3pt] \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_1}&amp;\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_2}&amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n^2}\\end{pmatrix}\\] Note that the hessian will be a symmetric matrix because \\(\\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2\\partial x_1}\\). Also note that given that \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) is of quadratic form, each element of the hessian will be a constant. These definitions will be employed when we determine the Second Order Conditions of a function: Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) and a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=0\\), Hessian is Positive Definite around \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Local Min Hessian is Negative Definite around \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Local Max Hessian is Indefinite around \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Saddle Point Furthermore, there’s an easier way to check whether a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix is positive or negative definite. Definiteness of 2 \\(\\times\\) 2 Matrix: For a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\[\\mathbf{A}= \\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12}\\\\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\\] If \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) &gt; 0\\) and \\(A_{11}&gt;0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is positive definite If \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) &gt; 0\\) and \\(A_{11}&lt;0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is negative definite If \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) &lt; 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is indefinite Example 11.3 (Max and min with two dimensions) We found that the only critical point of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=(x_1-1)^2+x_2^2+1\\) is at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*=(1,0)\\). Is it a min, max, or saddle point? Solution. The Hessian is \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{H(x)} &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;0\\\\0&amp;2 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align*}\\] Since \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{H}(x)) = 4 &gt; 0\\) and \\(H_{11}=2&gt;0\\), the Hessian is positive definite. Maxima, Minima, or Saddle Point? Since the Hessian is positive definite and the gradient equals 0, \\(x^\\star = (1,0)\\) is a local minimum. Note: Alternate check of definiteness. Is \\(\\mathbf{H(x^*)} \\geq \\leq 0 \\quad \\forall \\quad \\mathbf{x}\\ne 0\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{x}^\\top H(\\mathbf{x}^*) \\mathbf{x} &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 &amp; x_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &amp;= \\begin{pmatrix} 2&amp;0\\\\0&amp;2 \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ \\begin{pmatrix} x_1\\\\x_2\\end{pmatrix} &amp;= 2x_1^2+2x_2^2 \\end{align*}\\] For any \\(\\mathbf{x}\\ne 0\\), \\(2(x_1^2+x_2^2)&gt;0\\), so the Hessian is positive definite and \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a strict local minimum. Definiteness and Concavity Although definiteness helps us to understand the curvature of an n-dimensional function, it does not necessarily tell us whether the function is globally concave or convex. We need to know whether a function is globally concave or convex to determine whether a critical point is a global min or max. We can use the definiteness of the Hessian to determine whether a function is globally concave or convex: Hessian is Positive Semidefinite \\(\\forall \\mathbf{x}\\) \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Globally Convex Hessian is Negative Semidefinite \\(\\forall \\mathbf{x}\\) \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Globally Concave Notice that the definiteness conditions must be satisfied over the entire domain. 11.5 Global Maxima and Minima Global Max/Min Conditions: Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) and a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=0\\), Note that showing that \\(\\mathbf{H(x^*)}\\) is negative semidefinite is not enough to guarantee \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a local max. However, showing that \\(\\mathbf{H(x)}\\) is negative semidefinite for all \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) guarantees that \\(x^*\\) is a global max. (The same goes for positive semidefinite and minima.) Example: Take \\(f_1(x)=x^4\\) and \\(f_2(x)=-x^4\\). Both have \\(x=0\\) as a critical point. Unfortunately, \\(f&#39;&#39;_1(0)=0\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;_2(0)=0\\), so we can’t tell whether \\(x=0\\) is a min or max for either. However, \\(f&#39;&#39;_1(x)=12x^2\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;_2(x)=-12x^2\\). For all \\(x\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;_1(x)\\ge 0\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;_2(x)\\le 0\\) — i.e., \\(f_1(x)\\) is globally convex and \\(f_2(x)\\) is globally concave. So \\(x=0\\) is a global min of \\(f_1(x)\\) and a global max of \\(f_2(x)\\). Exercise 11.2 Given \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=x_1^3-x_2^3+9x_1x_2\\), find any maxima or minima. "],["integrals.html", "Chapter 12 Integral Calculus 12.1 The Indefinite Integral 12.2 The Definite Integral 12.3 Integration by Substitution 12.4 Integration by Parts Answers to Examples and Exercises", " Chapter 12 Integral Calculus 12.1 The Indefinite Integral So far, we’ve been interested in finding the derivative \\(f=F&#39;\\) of a function \\(F\\). However, sometimes we’re interested in exactly the reverse: finding the function \\(F\\) for which \\(f\\) is its derivative. We refer to \\(F\\) as the antiderivative of \\(f\\). Definition 12.1 (Antiderivative) The antiverivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is a differentiable function \\(F\\) whose derivative is \\(f\\). \\[F^\\prime = f.\\] Another way to describe is through the inverse formula. Let \\(DF\\) be the derivative of \\(F\\). And let \\(DF(x)\\) be the derivative of \\(F\\) evaluated at \\(x\\). Then the antiderivative is denoted by \\(D^{-1}\\) (i.e., the inverse derivative). If \\(DF=f\\), then \\(F=D^{-1}f\\). This definition bolsters the main takeaway about integrals and derivatives: They are inverses of each other. Exercise 12.1 (Antiderivative) Find the antiderivative of the following: \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\(f(x) = 3e^{3x}\\) We know from derivatives how to manipulate \\(F\\) to get \\(f\\). But how do you express the procedure to manipulate \\(f\\) to get \\(F\\)? For that, we need a new symbol, which we will call indefinite integration. Definition 12.2 (Indefinite Integral) The indefinite integral of \\(f(x)\\) is written \\[\\int f(x) dx \\] and is equal to the antiderivative of \\(f\\). Example 12.1 Draw the function \\(f(x)\\) and its indefinite integral, \\(\\int\\limits f(x) dx\\) \\[f(x) = (x^2-4)\\] Solution. The Indefinite Integral of the function \\(f(x) = (x^2-4)\\) can, for example, be \\(F(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x.\\) But it can also be \\(F(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x + 1\\), because the constant 1 disappears when taking the derivative. Some of these functions are plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 12.1 as dotted lines. Figure 12.1: The Many Indefinite Integrals of a Function Notice from these examples that while there is only a single derivative for any function, there are multiple antiderivatives: one for any arbitrary constant \\(c\\). \\(c\\) just shifts the curve up or down on the \\(y\\)-axis. If more information is present about the antiderivative — e.g., that it passes through a particular point — then we can solve for a specific value of \\(c\\). Properties of Integration Some useful properties of integrals follow by virtue of being the inverse of a derivative. Constants are allowed to slip out: \\(\\int a f(x)dx = a\\int f(x)dx\\) Integration of the sum is sum of integrations: \\(\\int [f(x)+g(x)]dx=\\int f(x)dx + \\int g(x)dx\\) Reverse Power-rule: \\(\\int x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + c\\) Exponents are still exponents: \\(\\int e^x dx = e^x +c\\) Recall the derivative of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is one over \\(x\\), and so: \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln x + c\\) Reverse chain-rule: \\(\\int e^{f(x)}f^\\prime(x)dx = e^{f(x)}+c\\) More generally: \\(\\int [f(x)]^n f&#39;(x)dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}[f(x)]^{n+1}+c\\) Remember the derivative of a log of a function: \\(\\int \\frac{f^\\prime(x)}{f(x)}dx=\\ln f(x) + c\\) Example 12.2 (Common Integration) Simplify the following indefinite integrals: \\(\\int 3x^2 dx\\) \\(\\int (2x+1)dx\\) \\(\\int e^x e^{e^x} dx\\) 12.2 The Definite Integral If there is a indefinite integral, there must be a definite integral. Indeed there is, but the notion of definite integrals comes from a different objective: finding the are a under a function. We will find, perhaps remarkably, that the formula we find to get the sum turns out to be expressible by the anti-derivative. Suppose we want to determine the area \\(A(R)\\) of a region \\(R\\) defined by a curve \\(f(x)\\) and some interval \\(a\\le x \\le b\\). Figure 12.2: The Riemann Integral as a Sum of Evaluations One way to calculate the area would be to divide the interval \\(a\\le x\\le b\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals of length \\(\\Delta x\\) and then approximate the region with a series of rectangles, where the base of each rectangle is \\(\\Delta x\\) and the height is \\(f(x)\\) at the midpoint of that interval. \\(A(R)\\) would then be approximated by the area of the union of the rectangles, which is given by \\[S(f,\\Delta x)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\] and is called a Riemann sum. As we decrease the size of the subintervals \\(\\Delta x\\), making the rectangles “thinner,” we would expect our approximation of the area of the region to become closer to the true area. This allows us to express the area as a limit of a series: \\[A(R)=\\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\] Figure 12.2 shows that illustration. The curve depicted is \\(f(x) = -15(x - 5) + (x - 5)^3 + 50.\\) We want approximate the area under the curve between the \\(x\\) values of 0 and 10. We can do this in blocks of arbitrary width, where the sum of rectangles (the area of which is width times \\(f(x)\\) evaluated at the midpoint of the bar) shows the Riemann Sum. As the width of the bars \\(\\Delta x\\) becomes smaller, the better the estimate of \\(A(R)\\). This is how we define the “Definite” Integral: Definition 12.3 (The Definite Integral (Riemann)) If for a given function \\(f\\) the Riemann sum approaches a limit as \\(\\Delta x \\to 0\\), then that limit is called the Riemann integral of \\(f\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). We express this with the \\(\\int\\), symbol, and write \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx= \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\] The most straightforward of a definite integral is the definite integral. That is, we read \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx\\] as the definite integral of \\(f\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) and we defined as the area under the “curve” \\(f(x)\\) from point \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\). The fundamental theorem of calculus shows us that this sum is, in fact, the antiderivative. Theorem 12.1 (First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) Let the function \\(f\\) be bounded on \\([a,b]\\) and continuous on \\((a,b)\\). Then, suggestively, use the symbol \\(F(x)\\) to denote the definite integral from \\(a\\) to \\(x\\): \\[F(x)=\\int\\limits_a^x f(t)dt, \\quad a\\le x\\le b\\] Then \\(F(x)\\) has a derivative at each point in \\((a,b)\\) and \\[F^\\prime(x)=f(x), \\quad a&lt;x&lt;b\\] That is, the definite integral function of \\(f\\) is the one of the antiderivatives of some \\(f\\). This is again a long way of saying that that differentiation is the inverse of integration. But now, we’ve covered definite integrals. The second theorem gives us a simple way of computing a definite integral as a function of indefinite integrals. Theorem 12.2 (Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) Let the function \\(f\\) be bounded on \\([a,b]\\) and continuous on \\((a,b)\\). Let \\(F\\) be any function that is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) such that \\(F^\\prime(x)=f(x)\\) on \\((a,b)\\). Then \\[\\int\\limits_a^bf(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)\\] So the procedure to calculate a simple definite integral \\(\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx\\) is then Find the indefinite integral \\(F(x)\\). Evaluate \\(F(b)-F(a)\\). Example 12.3 (Definite Integral of a monomial) Solve \\(\\int\\limits_1^3 3x^2 dx.\\) Let \\(f(x) = 3x^2\\). Exercise 12.2 What is the value of \\(\\int\\limits_{-2}^2 e^x e^{e^x} dx\\)? Properties for Definite Integrals The area-interpretation of the definite integral provides some useful properties for definite integrals There is no area below a point: \\[\\int\\limits_a^a f(x)dx=0\\] Reversing the limits changes the sign of the integral: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx=-\\int\\limits_b^a f(x)dx\\] Sums can be separated into their own integrals: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b [\\alpha f(x)+\\beta g(x)]dx = \\alpha \\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx + \\beta \\int\\limits_a^b g(x)dx\\] Areas can be combined as long as limits are linked: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx +\\int\\limits_b^c f(x)dx = \\int\\limits_a^c f(x)dx\\] Exercise 12.3 (Definite integral shortcuts) Simplify the following definite intergrals. \\(\\int\\limits_1^1 3x^2 dx =\\) \\(\\int\\limits_0^4 (2x+1)dx=\\) \\(\\int\\limits_{-2}^0 e^x e^{e^x} dx + \\int\\limits_0^2 e^x e^{e^x} dx =\\) 12.3 Integration by Substitution From the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we now that a quick way to get a definite integral is to first find the indefinite integral, and then just plug in the bounds. Sometimes the integrand (the thing that we are trying to take an integral of) doesn’t appear integrable using common rules and antiderivatives. A method one might try is integration by substitution, which is related to the Chain Rule. Suppose we want to find the indefinite integral \\[\\int g(x)dx\\] but \\(g(x)\\) is complex and none of the formulas we have seen so far seem to apply immediately. The trick is to come up with a new function \\(u(x)\\) such that \\[g(x)=f[u(x)]u&#39;(x).\\] Why does an introduction of yet another function end of simplifying things? Let’s refer to the antiderivative of \\(f\\) as \\(F\\). Then the chain rule tells us that \\[\\frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]=f[u(x)]u&#39;(x)\\]. So, \\(F[u(x)]\\) is the antiderivative of \\(g\\). We can then write \\[\\int g(x) dx= \\int f[u(x)]u&#39;(x)dx = \\int \\frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]dx = F[u(x)]+c\\] To summarize, the procedure to determine the indefinite integral \\(\\int g(x)dx\\) by the method of substitution: Identify some part of \\(g(x)\\) that might be simplified by substituting in a single variable \\(u\\) (which will then be a function of \\(x\\)). Determine if \\(g(x)dx\\) can be reformulated in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(du\\). Solve the indefinite integral. Substitute back in for \\(x\\) Substitution can also be used to calculate a definite integral. Using the same procedure as above, \\[\\int\\limits_a^b g(x)dx=\\int\\limits_c^d f(u)du = F(d)-F(c)\\] where \\(c=u(a)\\) and \\(d=u(b)\\). Example 12.4 (Integration by Substitution I) Solve the indefinite integral \\[\\int x^2 \\sqrt{x+1}dx.\\] For the above problem, we could have also used the substitution \\(u=\\sqrt{x+1}\\). Then \\(x=u^2-1\\) and \\(dx=2u du\\). Substituting these in, we get \\[\\int x^2\\sqrt{x+1}dx=\\int (u^2-1)^2 u 2u du\\] which when expanded is again a polynomial and gives the same result as above. Another case in which integration by substitution is is useful is with a fraction. Example 12.5 (Integration by Substitutiton II) Simplify \\[\\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{5e^{2x}}{(1+e^{2x})^{1/3}}dx.\\] 12.4 Integration by Parts Another useful integration technique is integration by parts, which is related to the Product Rule of differentiation. The product rule states that \\[\\frac{d}{dx}(uv)=u\\frac{dv}{dx}+v\\frac{du}{dx}\\] Integrating this and rearranging, we get \\[\\int u\\frac{dv}{dx}dx= u v - \\int v \\frac{du}{dx}dx\\] or \\[\\int u(x) v&#39;(x)dx=u(x)v(x) - \\int v(x)u&#39;(x)dx\\] More easily remembered with the mnemonic “Ultraviolet Voodoo”: \\[\\int u dv = u v - \\int v du\\] where \\(du=u&#39;(x)dx\\) and \\(dv=v&#39;(x)dx\\). For definite integrals, this is simply \\[\\int\\limits_a^b u\\frac{dv}{dx}dx = \\left. u v \\right|_a^b - \\int\\limits_a^b v \\frac{du}{dx}dx\\] Our goal here is to find expressions for \\(u\\) and \\(dv\\) that, when substituted into the above equation, yield an expression that’s more easily evaluated. Example 12.6 (Integration by Parts) Simplify the following integrals. These seemingly obscure forms of integrals come up often when integrating distributions. \\[\\int x e^{ax} dx\\] Solution. Let \\(u=x\\) and \\(\\frac{dv}{dx} = e^{ax}\\). Then \\(du=dx\\) and \\(v=(1/a)e^{ax}\\). Substituting this into the integration by parts formula, we obtain \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\int x e^{ax} dx &amp;=&amp; u v - \\int v du\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;x\\left( \\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\\right) -\\int\\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}dx\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{a}xe^{ax}-\\frac{1}{a^2}e^{ax}+c\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray}\\] Integrate \\[\\int x^n e^{ax} dx\\] Integrate \\[\\int x^3 e^{-x^2} dx\\] Answers to Examples and Exercises Exercise 10.1 \\(f^\\prime(x)= 0\\) \\(f^\\prime(x)= 1\\) \\(f^\\prime(x)= 2x^3\\) \\(f\\prime(x)= 3x^2\\) \\(f\\prime(x)= -2x^{-3}\\) \\(f\\prime(x)= 14x^6\\) \\(f\\prime(x) = 4x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x -1\\) \\(f\\prime(x) = 5x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x\\) \\(f\\prime(x) = 6x + \\frac{2}{3}x^{\\frac{-2}{3}}\\) \\(f\\prime(x)= \\frac{-4x}{x^4 - 2x^2 + 1}\\) Example 10.3 Solution. For convenience, define \\(f(z) = z^6\\) and \\(z = g(x) = 3x^2+5x-7\\). Then, \\(y=f[g(x)]\\) and \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}y&amp;= f^\\prime(z) g^\\prime(x) \\\\ &amp;= 6(3x^2+5x-7)^5 (6x + 5) \\end{align*}\\] Example 10.4 Let \\(u(x)=-3x\\). Then \\(u^\\prime(x)=-3\\) and \\(f^\\prime(x)=-3e^{-3x}\\). Let \\(u(x)=x^2\\). Then \\(u^\\prime(x)=2x\\) and \\(f^\\prime(x)=2xe^{x^2}\\). Example 10.5 Let \\(u(x)=x^2+9\\). Then \\(u^\\prime(x)=2x\\) and \\[\\frac{dy}{dx}= \\frac{u^\\prime(x)}{u(x)} = \\frac{2x}{(x^2+9)}\\] Let \\(u(x)=\\ln x\\). Then \\(u^\\prime(x)=1/x\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{(x\\ln x)}\\). Use the generalized power rule. \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{(2 \\ln x)}{x}\\] We know that \\(\\ln e^x=x\\) and that \\(dx/dx=1\\), but we can double check. Let \\(u(x)=e^x\\). Then \\(u^\\prime(x)=e^x\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{u^\\prime(x)}{u(x)} = \\frac{e^x}{e^x} = 1.\\) Example 12.3 Solution. What is \\(F(x)\\)? From the power rule, recognize \\(\\frac{d}{dx}x^3 = 3x^2\\) so \\[\\begin{align*} F(x) &amp;= x^3\\\\ \\int\\limits_1^3 f(x) dx &amp;= F(x = 3) - F(x - 1)\\\\ &amp;= 3^3 - 1^3\\\\ &amp;=26 \\end{align*}\\] Example 12.4 ::: {.solution} The problem here is the \\(\\sqrt{x+1}\\) term. However, if the integrand had \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) times some polynomial, then we’d be in business. Let’s try \\(u=x+1\\). Then \\(x=u-1\\) and \\(dx=du\\). Substituting these into the above equation, we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^2\\sqrt{x+1}dx&amp;= \\int (u-1)^2\\sqrt{u}du\\\\ &amp;= \\int (u^2-2u+1)u^{1/2}du\\\\ &amp;= \\int (u^{5/2}-2u^{3/2}+u^{1/2})du \\end{align*}\\] We can easily integrate this, since it is just a polynomial. Doing so and substituting \\(u=x+1\\) back in, we get \\[\\int x^2\\sqrt{x+1}dx=2(x+1)^{3/2}\\left[\\frac{1}{7}(x+1)^2 - \\frac{2}{5}(x+1)+\\frac{1}{3}\\right]+c\\] ::: Example 12.5 ::: {.solution} When an expression is raised to a power, it is often helpful to use this expression as the basis for a substitution. So, let \\(u=1+e^{2x}\\). Then \\(du=2e^{2x}dx\\) and we can set \\(5e^{2x}dx=5du/2\\). Additionally, \\(u=2\\) when \\(x=0\\) and \\(u=1+e^2\\) when \\(x=1\\). Substituting all of this in, we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{5e^{2x}}{(1+e^{2x})^{1/3}}dx &amp;= \\frac{5}{2}\\int\\limits_2^{1+e^2}\\frac{du}{u^{1/3}}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{5}{2}\\int\\limits_2^{1+e^2} u^{-1/3}du\\\\ &amp;= \\left. \\frac{15}{4} u^{2/3} \\right|_2^{1+e^2}\\\\ &amp;= 9.53 \\end{align*}\\] ::: Exercise ?? 1. \\[\\int x^n e^{ax} dx\\] ::: {.solution} As in the first problem, let \\[u=x^n, dv=e^{ax}dx\\] Then \\(du=n x^{n-1}dx\\) and \\(v=(1/a)e^{ax}\\). Substituting these into the integration by parts formula gives \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\int x^n e^{ax} dx &amp;=&amp; u v - \\int v du\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;x^n\\left( \\frac{1}{a}e^{ax}\\right) - \\int\\frac{1}{a}e^{ax} n x^{n-1} dx\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{a}x^n e^{ax} - \\frac{n}{a}\\int x^{n-1}e^{ax}dx\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray}\\] Notice that we now have an integral similar to the previous one, but with \\(x^{n-1}\\) instead of \\(x^n\\). For a given \\(n\\), we would repeat the integration by parts procedure until the integrand was directly integratable — e.g., when the integral became \\(\\int e^{ax}dx\\). ::: 2. \\[\\int x^3 e^{-x^2} dx\\] Solution. We could, as before, choose \\(u=x^3\\) and \\(dv=e^{-x^2}dx\\). But we can’t then find \\(v\\) — i.e., integrating \\(e^{-x^2}dx\\) isn’t possible. Instead, notice that \\[\\frac{d}{dx}e^{-x^2} = -2xe^{-x^2},\\] which can be factored out of the original integrand \\[\\int x^3 e^{-x^2} dx = \\int x^2 (xe^{-x^2})dx.\\] We can then let \\(u=x^2\\) and \\(dv=x e^{-x^2}dx\\).

Probability quantifies uncertainty, which is important because many things in the social world are at first uncertain. Inference is then the study of how to learn about facts you don’t observe from facts you do observe. 13.1 Counting Rules Probability in high school is usually really about combinatorics: the probability of event A is the number of ways in which A can occur divided by the number of all other possibilities. This is a very simplified version of probability, which we can call the “counting definition of probability”, essentially because each possible event to count is often equally likely and discrete. But it is still good to review the underlying rules here. Fundamental Theorem of Counting: If an object has \\(j\\) different characteristics that are independent of each other, and each characteristic \\(i\\) has \\(n_i\\) ways of being expressed, then there are \\(\\prod_{i = 1}^j n_i\\) possible unique objects. Example 13.1 (Counting Possibilities) Suppose we are given a stack of cards. Cards can be either red or black and can take on any of 13 values. There is only one of each color-number combination. In this case, \\(j =\\) \\(n_{\\text{color}} =\\) \\(n_{\\text{number}} =\\) Number of Outcomes \\(=\\) We often need to count the number of ways to choose a subset from some set of possibilities. The number of outcomes depends on two characteristics of the process: does the order matter and is replacement allowed? It is useful to think of any problem concretely, e.g. through a sampling table: If there are \\(n\\) objects which are numbered 1 to \\(n\\) and we select \\(k &lt; n\\) of them, how many different outcomes are possible? If the order in which a given object is selected matters, selecting 4 numbered objects in the following order (1, 3, 7, 2) and selecting the same four objects but in a different order such as (7, 2, 1, 3) will be counted as different outcomes. If replacement is allowed, there are always the same \\(n\\) objects to select from. However, if replacement is not allowed, there is always one less option than the previous round when making a selection. For example, if replacement is not allowed and I am selecting 3 elements from the following set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, I will have 6 options at first, 5 options as I make my second selection, and 4 options as I make my third. So if order matters AND we are sampling with replacement, the number of different outcomes is \\(n^k\\). If order matters AND we are sampling without replacement, the number of different outcomes is \\(n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\). If order doesn’t matter AND we are sampling without replacement, the number of different outcomes is \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\\). Expression \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is read as “n choose k” and denotes \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\\). Also, note that \\(0! = 1\\). Example 13.2 (Counting) There are five balls numbered from 1 through 5 in a jar. Three balls are chosen. How many possible choices are there? Ordered, with replacement \\(=\\) Ordered, without replacement \\(=\\) Unordered, without replacement \\(=\\) Exercise 13.1 (Counting) Four cards are selected from a deck of 52 cards. Once a card has been drawn, it is not reshuffled back into the deck. Moreover, we care only about the complete hand that we get (i.e. we care about the set of selected cards, not the sequence in which it was drawn). How many possible outcomes are there? 13.2 Sets Probability is about quantifying the uncertainty of events. Sets (set theory) are the mathematical way we choose to formalize those events. Events are not inherently numerical: the onset of war or the stock market crashing is not inherently a number. Sets can define such events, and we wrap math around so that we have a transparent language to communicate about those events. Measure theory might sound mysterious or hard, but it is also just a mathematical way to quantify things like length, volume, and mass. Probability can be thought of as a particular application of measure theory where we want to quantify the measure of a set. Set : A set is any well defined collection of elements. If \\(x\\) is an element of \\(S\\), \\(x \\in S\\). Sample Space (S): A set or collection of all possible outcomes from some process. Outcomes in the set can be discrete elements (countable) or points along a continuous interval (uncountable). Examples: Discrete: the numbers on a die, whether a vote cast is republican or democrat. Continuous: GNP, arms spending, age. Event: Any collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. Any subset of the full set of possibilities, including the full set itself. Event A \\(\\subset\\) S. Empty Set: a set with no elements. \\(S = \\{\\}\\). It is denoted by the symbol \\(\\emptyset\\). Set operations: Union: The union of two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cup B\\), is the set containing all of the elements in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). \\[A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\\] Intersection: The intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A \\cap B\\), is the set containing all of the elements in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \\[A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n = \\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\\] Complement: If set \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\), then the complement of \\(A\\), denoted \\(A^C\\), is the set containing all of the elements in \\(S\\) that are not in \\(A\\). Properties of set operations: Commutative: \\(A \\cup B = B \\cup A\\); \\(A \\cap B = B \\cap A\\) Associative: \\(A \\cup (B \\cup C) = (A \\cup B) \\cup C\\); \\(A \\cap (B \\cap C) = (A \\cap B) \\cap C\\) Distributive: \\(A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)\\); \\(A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)\\) de Morgan’s laws: \\((A \\cup B)^C = A^C \\cap B^C\\); \\((A \\cap B)^C = A^C \\cup B^C\\) Disjointness: Sets are disjoint when they do not intersect, such that \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\). A collection of sets is pairwise disjoint (mutually exclusive) if, for all \\(i \\neq j\\), \\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset\\). A collection of sets form a partition of set \\(S\\) if they are pairwise disjoint and they cover set \\(S\\), such that \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i = S\\). Example 13.3 (Sets) Let set \\(A\\) be {1, 2, 3, 4}, \\(B\\) be {3, 4, 5, 6}, and \\(C\\) be {5, 6, 7, 8}. Sets \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all subsets of the sample space \\(S\\) which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} Write out the following sets: \\(A \\cup B\\) \\(C \\cap B\\) \\(B^c\\) \\(A \\cap (B \\cup C)\\) Exercise 13.2 (Sets) Suppose you had a pair of four-sided dice. You sum the results from a single toss. What is the set of possible outcomes (i.e. the sample space)? Consider subsets A {2, 8} and B {2,3,7} of the sample space you found. What is \\(A^c\\) \\((A \\cup B)^c\\) 13.3 Probability Figure 13.1: Probablity as a Measure22 Probability Definitions: Formal and Informal Many things in the world are uncertain. In everyday speech, we say that we are uncertain about the outcome of random events. Probability is a formal model of uncertainty which provides a measure of uncertainty governed by a particular set of rules (Figure 13.1). A different model of uncertainty would, of course, have a set of rules different from anything we discuss here. Our focus on probability is justified because it has proven to be a particularly useful model of uncertainty. Probability Distribution Function: a mapping of each event in the sample space \\(S\\) to the real numbers that satisfy the following three axioms (also called Kolmogorov’s Axioms). Formally, Definition 13.1 (Probability) Probability is a function that maps events to a real number, obeying the axioms of probability. The axioms of probability make sure that the separate events add up in terms of probability, and – for standardization purposes – that they add up to 1. For any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A)\\ge 0\\). \\(P(S)=1\\) The Countable Additivity Axiom: For any sequence of disjoint (mutually exclusive) events \\(A_1,A_2,\\ldots\\) (of which there may be infinitely many), \\[P\\left( \\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^k A_i\\right)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(A_i)\\] The last axiom is an extension of a union to infinite sets. When there are only two events in the space, it boils down to: \\[\\begin{align*} P(A_1 \\cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) \\quad\\text{for disjoint } A_1, A_2 \\end{align*}\\] Probability Operations Using these three axioms, we can define all of the common rules of probability. \\(P(\\emptyset)=0\\) For any event \\(A\\), \\(0\\le P(A) \\le 1\\). \\(P({A}^C)=1-P(A)\\) If \\(A\\subset B\\) (\\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\)), then \\(P(A)\\le P(B)\\). For any two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)\\) Boole’s Inequality: For any sequence of \\(n\\) events (which need not be disjoint) \\(A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_n\\), then \\(P\\left( \\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\\right) \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n P(A_i)\\). Example 13.4 (Probability) Assume we have an evenly-balanced, six-sided die. Then, Sample space S = \\(P(1)=\\cdots=P(6)=\\) \\(P(\\emptyset)=P(7)=\\) \\(P\\left( \\{ 1, 3, 5 \\} \\right)=\\) \\(P\\left( \\{ 1, 2 \\}^C \\right)= P\\left( \\{ 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}\\right)=\\) Let \\(A=\\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \\}\\subset S\\). Then \\(P(A)=5/6&lt;P(S)=\\) Let \\(A=\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}\\) and \\(B=\\{ 2, 4, 6 \\}\\). Then \\(A\\cup B\\)? \\(A\\cap B\\)? \\(P(A \\cup B)\\)? Exercise 13.3 (Probability) Suppose you had a pair of four-sided dice. You sum the results from a single toss. Let us call this sum, or the outcome, X. What is \\(P(X = 5)\\), \\(P(X = 3)\\), \\(P(X = 6)\\)? What is \\(P(X=5 \\cup X = 3)^C\\)? 13.4 Conditional Probability Conditional Probability: The conditional probability \\(P(A|B)\\) of an event \\(A\\) is the probability of \\(A\\), given that another event \\(B\\) has occurred. Conditional probability allows for the inclusion of other information into the calculation of the probability of an event. It is calculated as \\[P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] Note that conditional probabilities are probabilities and must also follow the Kolmagorov axioms of probability. Example 13.5 (Conditional Probability 1) Assume \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur with the following frequencies: \\(\\quad\\) \\(A\\) \\(A^c\\) \\(B\\) \\(n_{ab}\\) \\(n_{a^cb}\\) \\(B^C\\) \\(n_{ab^c}\\) \\(n_{(ab)^c}\\) and let \\(n_{ab}+n_{a^Cb}+n_{ab^C}+n_{(ab)^C}=N\\). Then \\(P(A)=\\) \\(P(B)=\\) \\(P(A\\cap B)=\\) \\(P(A|B)= \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}=\\) \\(P(B|A)= \\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)}=\\) Example 13.6 (Conditional Probability 2) A six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of a 1, given the outcome is an odd number? You could rearrange the fraction to highlight how a joint probability could be expressed as the product of a conditional probability. Definition 13.2 (Multiplicative Law of Probability) The probability of the intersection of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B)\\) which follows directly from the definition of conditional probability. More generally, \\[P(A_1\\cap \\cdots\\cap A_k) = P(A_k| A_{k-1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_1)\\times P(A_{k-1}|A_{k-2}\\cap \\cdots A_1) \\times \\ldots \\times P(A_2|A_1)\\times P(A_1)\\] Sometimes it is easier to calculate these conditional probabilities and sum them than it is to calculate \\(P(A)\\) directly. Definition 13.3 (Law of Total Probability) Let \\(S\\) be the sample space of some experiment and let the disjoint \\(k\\) events \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_k\\) partition \\(S\\), such that \\(P(B_1\\cup ... \\cup B_k) = P(S) = 1\\). If \\(A\\) is some other event in \\(S\\), then the events \\(A\\cap B_1, A\\cap B_2, \\ldots, A\\cap B_k\\) will form a partition of \\(A\\) and we can write \\(A\\) as \\[A=(A\\cap B_1)\\cup\\cdots\\cup (A\\cap B_k)\\]. Since the \\(k\\) events are disjoint, \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(A)&amp;=&amp;\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(A \\cap B_i)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 13.5 Bayes Rule Bayes Rule: Assume that events \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_k\\) form a partition of the space \\(S\\). Then by the Law of Total Probability \\[P(B_j|A)= \\frac{P(A \\cap B_j)} {P(A)} = \\frac{P(B_j) P(A|B_j)}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i)}\\] If there are only two states of \\(B\\), then this is just \\[P(B_1|A)=\\frac{P(B_1)P(A|B_1)} {P(B_1)P(A|B_1)+P(B_2)P(A|B_2)}\\] Bayes’ rule determines the posterior probability of a state \\(P(B_j|A)\\) by calculating the probability \\(P(A \\cap B_j)\\) that both the event \\(A\\) and the state \\(B_j\\) will occur and dividing it by the probability that the event will occur regardless of the state (by summing across all \\(B_i\\)). The states could be something like Normal/Defective, Healthy/Diseased, Republican/Democrat/Independent, etc. The event on which one conditions could be something like a sampling from a batch of components, a test for a disease, or a question about a policy position. Prior and Posterior Probabilities: Above, \\(P(B_1)\\) is often called the prior probability, since it’s the probability of \\(B_1\\) before anything else is known. \\(P(B_1|A)\\) is called the posterior probability, since it’s the probability after other information is taken into account. Example 13.7 (Bayes' Rule) In a given town, 40% of the voters are Democrat and 60% are Republican. The president’s budget is supported by 50% of the Democrats and 90% of the Republicans. If a randomly (equally likely) selected voter is found to support the president’s budget, what is the probability that they are a Democrat? Exercise 13.4 (Conditional Probability) Assume that 2% of the population of the U.S. are members of some extremist militia group. We develop a survey that positively classifies someone as being a member of a militia group given that they are a member 95% of the time and negatively classifies someone as not being a member of a militia group given that they are not a member 97% of the time. What is the probability that someone positively classified as being a member of a militia group is actually a militia member? 13.6 Independence Definition 13.4 (Independence) If the occurrence or nonoccurrence of either events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no effect on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the other, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, then \\(P(A|B)=P(A)\\) \\(P(B|A)=P(B)\\) \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B)\\) More generally than the above, \\(P(\\bigcap_{i=1}^k A_i) = \\prod_{i = 1}^K P(A_i)\\) Are mutually exclusive events independent of each other? No. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then they cannot happen simultaneously. If we know that A occurred, then we know that B couldn’t have occurred. Because of this, A and B aren’t independent. Pairwise Independence: A set of more than two events \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\) is pairwise independent if \\(P(A_i\\cap A_j)=P(A_i)P(A_j)\\), \\(\\forall i\\neq j\\). Note that this does not necessarily imply joint independence. Conditional Independence: If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent once you know the occurrence of a third event \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are conditionally independent (conditional on \\(C\\)): \\(P(A|B \\cap C)=P(A|C)\\) \\(P(B|A \\cap C)=P(B|C)\\) \\(P(A\\cap B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)\\) Just because two events are conditionally independent does not mean that they are independent. Actually it is hard to think of real-world things that are “unconditionally” independent. That’s why it’s always important to ask about a finding: What was it conditioned on? For example, suppose that a graduate school admission decisions are done by only one professor, who picks a group of 50 bright students and flips a coin for each student to generate a class of about 25 students. Then the the probability that two students get accepted are conditionally independent, because they are determined by two separate coin tosses. However, this does not mean that their admittance is not completely independent. Knowing that student \\(A\\) got in gives us information about whether student \\(B\\) got in, if we think that the professor originally picked her pool of 50 students by merit. Perhaps more counter-intuitively: If two events are already independent, then it might seem that no amount of “conditioning” will make them dependent. But this is not always so. For example23, suppose I only get a call from two people, Alice and Bob. Let \\(A\\) be the event that Alice calls, and \\(B\\) be the event that Bob calls. Alice and Bob do not communicate, so \\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A).\\) But now let \\(C\\) be the event that your phone rings. For conditional independence to hold here, then \\(P(A \\mid C)\\) must be equal to \\(P(A \\mid B \\cap C).\\) But this is not true – \\(A \\mid C\\) may or may not be true, but \\(P(A \\mid B \\cap C)\\) certainly is true. 13.7 Random Variables Most questions in the social sciences involve events, rather than numbers per se. To analyze and reason about events quantitatively, we need a way of mapping events to numbers. A random variable does exactly that. Figure 13.2: The Random Variable as a Real-Valued Function Definition 13.5 (Random Variable) A random variable is a measurable function \\(X\\) that maps from the sample space \\(S\\) to the set of real numbers \\(R.\\) It assigns a real number to every outcome \\(s \\in S\\). Figure 13.2 shows a image of the function. It might seem strange to define a random variable as a function – which is neither random nor variable. The randomness comes from the realization of an event from the sample space \\(s\\). Randomness means that the outcome of some experiment is not deterministic, i.e. there is some probability (\\(0 &lt; P(A) &lt; 1\\)) that the event will occur. The support of a random variable is all values for which there is a positive probability of occurrence. Example: Flip a fair coin two times. What is the sample space? A random variable must map events to the real line. For example, let a random variable \\(X\\) be the number of heads. The event \\((H, H)\\) gets mapped to 2 \\(X(s) = 2\\), and the events \\(\\{(H, T), (T, H)\\}\\) gets mapped to 1 \\((X(s) = 1)\\), the event \\((T, T)\\) gets mapped to 0 \\((X(s) = 0)\\). What are other possible random variables? 13.8 Distributions We now have two main concepts in this section – probability and random variables. Given a sample space \\(S\\) and the same experiment, both probability and random variables take events as their inputs. But they output different things (probabilities measure the “size” of events, random variables give a number in a way that the analyst chose to define the random variable). How do the two concepts relate? The concept of distributions is the natural bridge between these two concepts. Definition 13.6 (Distribution of a random variable) A distribution of a random variable is a function that specifies the probabilities of all events associated with that random variable. There are several types of distributions: A probability mass function for a discrete random variable and probability density function for a continuous random variable. Notice how the definition of distributions combines two ideas of random variables and probabilities of events. First, the distribution considers a random variable, call it \\(X\\). \\(X\\) can take a number of possible numeric values. Example 13.8 (Total Number of Occurrences) Consider three binary outcomes, one for each patient recovering from a disease: \\(R_i\\) denotes the event in which patient \\(i\\) (\\(i = 1, 2, 3\\)) recovers from a disease. \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), and \\(R_3\\). How would we represent the total number of people who end up recovering from the disease? Solution. Define the random variable \\(X\\) be the total number of people (out of three) who recover from the disease. Random variables are functions, that take as an input a set of events (in the sample space \\(S\\)) and deterministically assigns them to a number of the analyst’s choice. Recall that with each of these numerical values there is a class of events. In the previous example, for \\(X = 3\\) there is one outcome (\\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\)) and for \\(X = 1\\) there are multiple (\\(\\{(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2^c, R_3), \\}\\)). Now, the thing to notice here is that each of these events naturally come with a probability associated with them. That is, \\(P(R_1, R_2, R_3)\\) is a number from 0 to 1, as is \\(P(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c)\\). These all have probabilities because they are in the sample space \\(S\\). The function that tells us these probabilities that are associated with a numerical value of a random variable is called a distribution. In other words, a random variable \\(X\\) induces a probability distribution \\(P\\) (sometimes written \\(P_X\\) to emphasize that the probability density is about the r.v. \\(X\\)) Discrete Random Variables The formal definition of a random variable is easier to given by separating out two cases: discrete random variables when the numeric summaries of the events are discrete, and continuous random variables when they are continuous. Definition 13.7 (Discrete Random Variable) \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable if it can assume only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Examples: number of wars per year, heads or tails. The distribution of a discrete r.v. is a PMF: Definition 13.8 (Probability Mass Function) For a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the probability mass function (Also referred to simply as the “probability distribution.”) (PMF), \\(p(x)=P(X=x)\\), assigns probabilities to a countable number of distinct \\(x\\) values such that \\(0\\le p(x)\\le 1\\) \\(\\sum\\limits_y p(x)=1\\) Example: For a fair six-sided die, there is an equal probability of rolling any number. Since there are six sides, the probability mass function is then \\(p(y)=1/6\\) for \\(y=1,\\ldots,6\\), 0 otherwise.} In a discrete random variable, cumulative distribution function (Also referred to simply as the “cumulative distribution” or previously as the “distribution function”), \\(F(x)\\) or \\(P(X\\le x)\\), is the probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to some value \\(x\\), or \\[P(X\\le x)=\\sum\\limits_{i\\le x} p(i)\\] Properties a CDF must satisfy: \\(F(x)\\) is non-decreasing in \\(x\\). \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to -\\infty} F(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1\\) \\(F(x)\\) is right-continuous. Note that \\(P(X &gt; x) = 1 - P(X \\le x)\\). Example 13.9 For a fair die with its value as \\(Y\\), What are the following? \\(P(Y\\le 1)\\) \\(P(Y\\le 3)\\) \\(P(Y\\le 6)\\) Continuous Random Variables We also have a similar definition for continuous random variables. Definition 13.9 (Continuous Random Variable) \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable if there exists a nonnegative function \\(f(x)\\) defined for all real \\(x\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)\\), such that for any interval \\(A\\), \\(P(X\\in A)=\\int\\limits_A f(x)dx\\). Examples: age, income, GNP, temperature. Definition 13.10 (Probability Density Function) The function \\(f\\) above is called the probability density function (pdf) of \\(X\\) and must satisfy \\[f(x)\\ge 0\\] \\[\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)dx=1\\] Note also that \\(P(X = x)=0\\) — i.e., the probability of any point \\(y\\) is zero. For both discrete and continuous random variables, we have a unifying concept of another measure: the cumulative distribution: Definition 13.11 (Cumulative Distribution Function) Because the probability that a continuous random variable will assume any particular value is zero, we can only make statements about the probability of a continuous random variable being within an interval. The cumulative distribution gives the probability that \\(Y\\) lies on the interval \\((-\\infty,y)\\) and is defined as \\[F(x)=P(X\\le x)=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^x f(s)ds\\] Note that \\(F(x)\\) has similar properties with continuous distributions as it does with discrete - non-decreasing, continuous (not just right-continuous), and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to -\\infty} F(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1\\). We can also make statements about the probability of \\(Y\\) falling in an interval \\(a\\le y\\le b\\). \\[P(a\\le x\\le b)=\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx\\] The PDF and CDF are linked by the integral: The CDF of the integral of the PDF: \\[f(x) = F&#39;(x)=\\frac{dF(x)}{dx}\\] Example 13.10 For \\(f(y)=1, \\quad 0&lt;y&lt;1\\), find: (1) The CDF \\(F(y)\\) and (2) The probability \\(P(0.5&lt;y&lt;0.75)\\).

The most important summary is the expectation (or expected value, or mean), in which the possible values of a random variable are weighted by their probabilities. Definition 14.1 (Expectation of a Discrete Random Variable) The expected value of a discrete random variable \\(Y\\) is \\[E(Y)=\\sum\\limits_{y} y P(Y=y)= \\sum\\limits_{y} y p(y)\\] In words, it is the weighted average of all possible values of \\(Y\\), weighted by the probability that \\(y\\) occurs. It is not necessarily the number we would expect \\(Y\\) to take on, but the average value of \\(Y\\) after a large number of repetitions of an experiment. Example 14.1 (Expectation of a Discrete Random Variable) What is the expectation of a fair, six-sided die? Expectation of a Continuous Random Variable: The expected value of a continuous random variable is similar in concept to that of the discrete random variable, except that instead of summing using probabilities as weights, we integrate using the density to weight. Hence, the expected value of the continuous variable \\(Y\\) is defined by \\[E(Y)=\\int\\limits_{y} y f(y) dy\\] Example 14.2 (Expectation of a Continuous Random Variable) Find \\(E(Y)\\) for \\(f(y)=\\frac{1}{1.5}, \\quad 0&lt;y&lt;1.5\\). Expected Value of a Function Remember: An Expected Value is a type of weighted average. We can extend this to composite functions. For random variable \\(Y\\), If \\(Y\\) is Discrete with PMF \\(p(y)\\), \\[E[g(Y)]=\\sum\\limits_y g(y)p(y)\\] If \\(Y\\) is Continuous with PDF \\(f(y)\\), \\[E[g(Y)]=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(y)f(y)dy\\] Properties of Expected Values Dealing with Expectations is easier when the thing inside is a sum. The intuition behind this that Expectation is an integral, which is a type of sum. Expectation of a constant is a constant \\[E(c)=c\\] Constants come out \\[E(c g(Y))= c E(g(Y))\\] Expectation is Linear \\[E(g(Y_1) + \\cdots + g(Y_n))=E(g(Y_1)) +\\cdots+E(g(Y_n)),\\] regardless of independence Expected Value of Expected Values: \\[E(E(Y)) = E(Y)\\] (because the expected value of a random variable is a constant) Finally, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, even products are easy: \\[E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)\\] Conditional Expectation: With joint distributions, we are often interested in the expected value of a variable \\(Y\\) if we could hold the other variable \\(X\\) fixed. This is the conditional expectation of \\(Y\\) given \\(X = x\\): \\(Y\\) discrete: \\(E(Y|X = x) = \\sum_y yp_{Y|X}(y|x)\\) \\(Y\\) continuous: \\(E(Y|X = x) = \\int_y yf_{Y|X}(y|x)dy\\) The conditional expectation is often used for prediction when one knows the value of \\(X\\) but not \\(Y\\) 14.2 Variance and Covariance We can also look at other summaries of the distribution, which build on the idea of taking expectations. Variance tells us about the “spread” of the distribution; it is the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean of the distribution. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. Definition 14.2 (Variance) The Variance of a Random Variable \\(Y\\) is \\[\\text{Var}(Y) = E[(Y - E(Y))^2] = E(Y^2)-[E(Y)]^2\\] The Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance : \\[SD(Y) = \\sigma_Y= \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(Y)}\\] Example 14.3 (Variance) Given the following PMF: \\[f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{3!}{x!(3-x)!}(\\frac{1}{2})^3 \\quad x = 0,1,2,3\\\\ 0 \\quad otherwise \\end{cases} \\] What is \\(\\text{Var}(x)\\)? Hint: First calculate \\(E(X)\\) and \\(E(X^2)\\) Definition 14.3 (Covariance and Correlation) The covariance measures the degree to which two random variables vary together; if the covariance between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is positive, X tends to be larger than its mean when Y is larger than its mean. \\[\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))] \\] We can also write this as \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Cov}(X,Y) &amp;= E\\left(XY - XE(Y) - E(X)Y + E(X)E(Y)\\right)\\\\ &amp;= E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) - E(X)E(Y) + E(X)E(Y)\\\\ &amp;= E(XY) - E(X)E(Y) \\end{align*}\\] The covariance of a variable with itself is the variance of that variable. The Covariance is unfortunately hard to interpret in magnitude. The correlation is a standardized version of the covariance, and always ranges from -1 to 1. Definition 14.4 (Correlation) The correlation coefficient is the covariance divided by the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). It is a unitless measure and always takes on values in the interval \\([-1,1]\\). \\[\\text{Corr}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{SD(X)SD(Y)}\\] Properties of Variance and Covariance: \\(\\text{Var}(c) = 0\\) \\(\\text{Var}(cY) = c^2 \\text{Var}(Y)\\) \\(\\text{Cov}(Y,Y) = \\text{Var}(Y)\\) \\(\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \\text{Cov}(Y,X)\\) \\(\\text{Cov}(aX,bY) = ab \\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\) \\(\\text{Cov}(X+a,Y) = \\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\) \\(\\text{Cov}(X+Z,Y+W) = \\text{Cov}(X,Y) + \\text{Cov}(X,W) + \\text{Cov}(Z,Y) + \\text{Cov}(Z,W)\\) \\(\\text{Var}(X+Y) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) + 2\\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\) Exercise 14.1 (Expectation and Variance) Suppose we have a PMF with the following characteristics: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} P(X = -2) = \\frac{1}{5}\\\\ P(X = -1) = \\frac{1}{6}\\\\ P(X = 0) = \\frac{1}{5}\\\\ P(X = 1) = \\frac{1}{15}\\\\ P(X = 2) = \\frac{11}{30} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Calculate the expected value of X Define the random variable \\(Y = X^2\\). Calculate the expected value of Y. (Hint: It would help to derive the PMF of Y first in order to calculate the expected value of Y in a straightforward way) Calculate the variance of X. Find the expectation and variance Given the following PDF: \\[f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{3}{10}(3x - x^2) \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\\\ 0 \\quad otherwise \\end{cases} \\] Find the mean and standard deviation of random variable X. The PDF of this X is as follows: \\[f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{4}x \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\\\ \\frac{1}{4}(4 - x) \\quad 2 \\leq x \\leq 4\\\\ 0 \\quad otherwise \\end{cases} \\] Next, calculate \\(P(X &lt; \\mu - \\sigma)\\) Remember, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation 14.3 Common Distributions Two discrete distributions used often are: Definition 14.5 (Binomial Distribution) \\(Y\\) is distributed binomial if it represents the number of “successes” observed in \\(n\\) independent, identical “trials,” where the probability of success in any trial is \\(p\\) and the probability of failure is \\(q=1-p\\). For any particular sequence of \\(y\\) successes and \\(n-y\\) failures, the probability of obtaining that sequence is \\(p^y q^{n-y}\\) (by the multiplicative law and independence). However, there are \\(\\binom{n}{y}=\\frac{n!}{(n-y)!y!}\\) ways of obtaining a sequence with \\(y\\) successes and \\(n-y\\) failures. So the binomial distribution is given by \\[p(y)=\\binom{n}{y}p^y q^{n-y}, \\quad y=0,1,2,\\ldots,n\\] with mean \\(\\mu=E(Y)=np\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=\\text{Var}(Y)=npq\\). Example 14.4 Republicans vote for Democrat-sponsored bills 2% of the time. What is the probability that out of 10 Republicans questioned, half voted for a particular Democrat-sponsored bill? What is the mean number of Republicans voting for Democrat-sponsored bills? The variance? 1. \\(P(Y=5)=\\) 1. \\(E(Y)=\\) 1. \\(\\text{Var}(Y)=6\\) Definition 14.6 (Poisson Distribution) A random variable \\(Y\\) has a Poisson distribution if \\[P(Y = y)=\\frac{\\lambda^y}{y!}e^{-\\lambda}, \\quad y=0,1,2,\\ldots, \\quad \\lambda&gt;0\\] The Poisson has the unusual feature that its expectation equals its variance: \\(E(Y)=\\text{Var}(Y)=\\lambda\\). The Poisson distribution is often used to model rare event counts: counts of the number of events that occur during some unit of time. \\(\\lambda\\) is often called the “arrival rate.” Example 14.5 Border disputes occur between two countries through a Poisson Distribution, at a rate of 2 per month. What is the probability of 0, 2, and less than 5 disputes occurring in a month? Two continuous distributions used often are: Definition 14.7 (Uniform Distribution) A random variable \\(Y\\) has a continuous uniform distribution on the interval \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) if its density is given by \\[f(y)=\\frac{1}{\\beta-\\alpha}, \\quad \\alpha\\le y\\le \\beta\\] The mean and variance of \\(Y\\) are \\(E(Y)=\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\) and \\(\\text{Var}(Y)=\\frac{(\\beta-\\alpha)^2}{12}\\). Example 14.6 For \\(Y\\) uniformly distributed over \\((1,3)\\), what are the following probabilities? \\(P(Y=2)\\) Its density evaluated at 2, or \\(f(2)\\) \\(P(Y \\le 2)\\) \\(P(Y &gt; 2)\\) Definition 14.8 (Normal Distribution) A random variable \\(Y\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(E(Y)=\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\text{Var}(Y)=\\sigma^2\\) if its density is \\[f(y)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(y-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\] See Figure 14.1 are various Normal Distributions with the same \\(\\mu = 1\\) and two versions of the variance. Figure 14.1: Normal Distribution Density 14.4 Joint Distributions Often, we are interested in two or more random variables defined on the same sample space. The distribution of these variables is called a joint distribution. Joint distributions can be made up of any combination of discrete and continuous random variables. Joint Probability Distribution: If both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are random variable, their joint probability mass/density function assigns probabilities to each pair of outcomes Discrete: \\[p(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y)\\] such that \\(p(x,y) \\in [0,1]\\) and \\[\\sum\\sum p(x,y) = 1\\] Continuous: \\[f(x,y);P((X,Y) \\in A) = \\int\\!\\!\\!\\int_A f(x,y)dx dy \\] s.t. \\(f(x,y)\\ge 0\\) and \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x,y)dxdy = 1\\] If X and Y are independent, then \\(P(X=x,Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y)\\) and \\(f(x,y) = f(x)f(y)\\) Marginal Probability Distribution: probability distribution of only one of the two variables (ignoring information about the other variable), we can obtain the marginal distribution by summing/integrating across the variable that we don’t care about: Discrete: \\(p_X(x) = \\sum_i p(x, y_i)\\) Continuous: \\(f_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x,y)dy\\) Conditional Probability Distribution: probability distribution for one variable, holding the other variable fixed. Recalling from the previous lecture that \\(P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\), we can write the conditional distribution as Discrete: \\(p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p_X(x)}, \\quad p_X(x) &gt; 0\\) Continuous: \\(f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \\frac{f(x,y)}{f_X(x)},\\quad f_X(x) &gt; 0\\) Exercise 14.2 (Discrete Outcomes) Suppose we are interested in the outcomes of flipping a coin and rolling a 6-sided die at the same time. The sample space for this process contains 12 elements: \\[\\{(H, 1), (H, 2), (H, 3), (H, 4), (H, 5), (H, 6), (T, 1), (T, 2), (T, 3), (T, 4), (T, 5), (T, 6)\\}\\] We can define two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) such that \\(X = 1\\) if heads and \\(X = 0\\) if tails, while \\(Y\\) equals the number on the die. We can then make statements about the joint distribution of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). What are the following? \\(P(X=x)\\) \\(P(Y=y)\\) \\(P(X=x, Y=y)\\) \\(P(X=x|Y=y)\\) Are X and Y independent? "],["statistics.html", "Chapter 15 Learning from Data 15.1 Summarizing Data 15.2 Law of Large Numbers 15.3 Central Limit Theorem Answers to Examples and Exercises", " Chapter 15 Learning from Data 15.1 Summarizing Data So far, we’ve talked about distributions in a theoretical sense, looking at different properties of random variables. We don’t observe random variables; we observe realizations of the random variable. These realizations of events are roughly equivalent to what we mean by “data”. Sample mean: This is the most common measure of central tendency, calculated by summing across the observations and dividing by the number of observations. \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\] The sample mean is an estimate of the expected value of a distribution. Dispersion: We also typically want to know how spread out the data are relative to the center of the observed distribution. There are several ways to measure dispersion. Sample variance: The sample variance is the sum of the squared deviations from the sample mean, divided by the number of observations minus 1. \\[ \\hat{\\text{Var}}(X) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\] Again, this is an estimate of the variance of a random variable; we divide by \\(n - 1\\) instead of \\(n\\) in order to get an unbiased estimate. Standard deviation: The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance. \\[ \\hat{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\text{Var}}(X)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\] Covariance and Correlation: Both of these quantities measure the degree to which two variables vary together, and are estimates of the covariance and correlation of two random variables as defined above. Sample covariance: \\(\\hat{\\text{Cov}}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\\) Sample correlation: \\(\\hat{\\text{Corr}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\text{Cov}}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\text{Var}}(X)\\hat{\\text{Var}}(Y)}}\\) Example 15.1 Example: Using the above table, calculate the sample versions of: \\(\\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\) \\(\\text{Corr}(X, Y)\\) 15.2 Law of Large Numbers In probability theory, asymptotic analysis is the study of limiting behavior. By limiting behavior, we mean the behavior of some random process as the number of observations gets larger and larger. Why is this important? We rarely know the true process governing the events we see in the social world. It is helpful to understand how such unknown processes theoretically must behave and asymptotic theory helps us do this. Theorem 15.1 (Law of Large Numbers (LLN)) For any draw of independent random variables with the same mean \\(\\mu\\), the sample average after \\(n\\) draws, \\(\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_n)\\), converges in probability to the expected value of \\(X\\), \\(\\mu\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\): \\[\\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty} P(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu | &gt; \\varepsilon) = 0\\] A shorthand of which is \\(\\bar{X}_n \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu\\), where the arrow is read as “converges in probability to”. as \\(n\\to \\infty\\). In other words, \\(P( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\bar{X}_n = \\mu) = 1\\). This is an important motivation for the widespread use of the sample mean, as well as the intuition link between averages and expected values. More precisely this version of the LLN is called the weak law of large numbers because it leaves open the possibility that \\(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu | &gt; \\varepsilon\\) occurs many times. The strong law of large numbers states that, under a few more conditions, the probability that the limit of the sample average is the true mean is 1 (and other possibilities occur with probability 0), but the difference is rarely consequential in practice. The Strong Law of Large Numbers holds so long as the expected value exists; no other assumptions are needed. However, the rate of convergence will differ greatly depending on the distribution underlying the observed data. When extreme observations occur often (i.e. kurtosis is large), the rate of convergence is much slower. Cf. The distribution of financial returns. 15.3 Central Limit Theorem We are now finally ready to revisit, with a bit more precise terms, the two pillars of statistical theory we motivated Section 9.3 with. Theorem 15.2 (Central Limit Theorem (i.i.d. case)) Let \\(\\{X_n\\} = \\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\}\\) be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). Then, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n}{n}\\) increasingly converges into a Normal distribution. \\[\\frac{\\bar{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\xrightarrow{d} \\text{Normal}(0, 1),\\] Another way to write this as a probability statement is that for all real numbers \\(a\\), \\[P\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\le a\\right) \\rightarrow \\Phi(a)\\] as \\(n\\to \\infty\\), where \\[\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} \\, dx\\] is the CDF of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. This result means that, as \\(n\\) grows, the distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar X_n = \\frac{1}{n} (X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n)\\) is approximately normal with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\\), i.e., \\[\\bar{X}_n \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\bigg(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\bigg).\\] The standard deviation of \\(\\bar X_n\\) (which is roughly a measure of the precision of \\(\\bar X_n\\) as an estimator of \\(\\mu\\)) decreases at the rate \\(1/\\sqrt{n}\\), so, for example, to increase its precision by \\(10\\) (i.e., to get one more digit right), one needs to collect \\(10^2=100\\) times more units of data. Intuitively, this result also justifies that whenever a lot of small, independent processes somehow combine together to form the realized observations, practitioners often feel comfortable assuming Normality.
