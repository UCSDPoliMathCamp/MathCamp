Probability quantifies uncertainty, which is important because many things in the social world are at first uncertain. Inference is then the study of how to learn about facts you don't observe from facts you do  observe.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n## Counting Rules\n\nProbability in high school is usually really about combinatorics: the probability of event _A_ is the number of ways in which _A_ can occur divided by the number of all other possibilities. This is a very simplified version of probability, which we can call the \"counting definition of probability\", essentially because each possible event to count is often equally likely and discrete. But it is still good to review the underlying rules here.\n\n\n__Fundamental Theorem of Counting__: If an object has $j$ different characteristics that are independent of each other, and each characteristic $i$ has $n_i$ ways of being expressed, then there are $\\prod_{i = 1}^j n_i$ possible unique objects.\n\n:::{#exm-countingrules}\n\nSuppose we are given a stack of cards. Cards can be either red or black and can take on any of 13 values. There is only one of each color-number combination. In this case,\n\n1. $j =$\n\n2. $n_{\\text{color}} =$ \n\n3. $n_{\\text{number}} =$ \n\n4. Number of Outcomes $=$\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe often need to count the number of ways to choose a subset from some set of possibilities.  The number of outcomes depends on two characteristics of the process: does the order matter and is replacement allowed?\n\nIt is useful to think of any problem concretely, e.g. through a __sampling table__: If there are $n$ objects which are numbered 1 to $n$ and we select $k < n$ of them, how many different outcomes are possible?\n\nIf the order in which a given object is selected matters, selecting 4 numbered objects in the following order (1, 3, 7, 2) and selecting the same four objects but in a different order such as (7, 2, 1, 3) will be counted as different outcomes. \n\nIf replacement is allowed, there are always the same $n$ objects to select from. However, if replacement is not allowed, there is always one less option than the previous round when making a selection. For example, if replacement is not allowed and I am selecting 3 elements from the following set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, I will have 6 options at first, 5 options as I make my second selection, and 4 options as I make my third. \n\n\n1. So if ___order matters___ AND we are sampling ___with replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $n^k$.\n\n2. If  ___order matters___ AND we are sampling ___without replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\n\n3. If  ___order doesn't matter___ AND we are sampling ___without replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$.\n\n\nExpression $\\binom{n}{k}$ is read as \"n choose k\" and denotes $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$. Also, note that $0! = 1$.\n\n:::{#exm-counting}\n\n### Counting\nThere are five balls numbered from 1 through 5 in a jar. Three balls are chosen. How many possible choices are there?\n\n1. Ordered, with replacement $=$ \n\n2. Ordered, without replacement $=$ \n\n3. Unordered, without replacement $=$ \n\n:::\n\n:::{#exr-counting1}\n### Counting\nFour cards are selected from a deck of 52 cards. Once a card has been drawn, it is not reshuffled back into the deck. Moreover, we care only about the complete hand that we get (i.e. we care about the set of selected cards, not the sequence in which it was drawn). How many possible outcomes are there?\n:::\n\n\n## Sets {#setoper}\n\nProbability is about quantifying the uncertainty of events. _Sets_ (set theory) are the mathematical way we choose to formalize those events. Events are not inherently numerical: the onset of war or the stock market crashing is not inherently a number. Sets can define such events, and we wrap math around so that we have a transparent language to communicate about those events. _Measure theory_ might sound mysterious or hard, but it is also just a mathematical way to quantify things like length, volume, and mass. Probability can be thought of as a particular application of measure theory where we want to quantify the measure of a set. \n\n\n__Set__ : A set is any well defined collection of elements.  If $x$ is an element of $S$, $x \\in S$.\n\n__Sample Space (S)__:  A set or collection of all possible outcomes from some process.  Outcomes in the set can be discrete elements (countable) or points along a continuous interval (uncountable).\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Discrete:  the numbers on a die, whether a vote cast is republican or democrat.\n2. Continuous: GNP, arms spending, age.\n\n__Event__: Any collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. Any subset of the full set of possibilities, including the full set itself. Event A $\\subset$ S.\n\n__Empty Set__: a set with no elements.  $S = \\{\\}$. It is denoted by the symbol $\\emptyset$.\n\n\nSet operations:\n\n1. __Union__: The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, $A \\cup B$, is the set containing all of the elements in $A$ or $B$. $$A_1 \\cup A_2  \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$$\n2. __Intersection__: The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, $A \\cap B$, is the set containing all of the elements in both $A$ and $B$. $$A_1 \\cap A_2  \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n = \\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i$$\n3. __Complement__: If set $A$ is a subset of $S$, then the complement of $A$, denoted $A^C$, is the set containing all of the elements in $S$ that are not in $A$.\n\n\nProperties of set operations:\n\n* __Commutative__: $A \\cup B = B \\cup A$; $A \\cap B = B \\cap A$\n* __Associative__: $A \\cup (B \\cup C) = (A \\cup B) \\cup C$; $A \\cap (B \\cap C) = (A \\cap B) \\cap C$\n* __Distributive__: $A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)$; $A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)$\n* __de Morgan's laws__: $(A \\cup B)^C = A^C \\cap B^C$; $(A \\cap B)^C = A^C \\cup B^C$\n* __Disjointness__: Sets are disjoint when they do not intersect, such that $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.  A collection of sets is pairwise disjoint (**mutually exclusive**) if, for all $i \\neq j$, $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$.  A collection of sets form a partition of set $S$ if they are pairwise disjoint and they cover set $S$, such that $\\bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i = S$.\n\n\n:::{#exm-sets}\n\n### Sets\n\nLet set $A$ be {1, 2, 3, 4}, $B$ be {3, 4, 5, 6}, and $C$ be {5, 6, 7, 8}.

In everyday speech, we say that we are  _uncertain_ about the outcome of random events. Probability is a formal model of uncertainty which provides a measure of uncertainty governed by a particular set of rules (@fig-prob-image). A different model of uncertainty would, of course, have a set of rules different from anything we discuss here.  Our focus on probability is justified because it has proven to be a particularly useful model of uncertainty.\n\n\n__Probability Distribution Function__: a mapping of each event in the sample space $S$ to the real numbers that satisfy the following three axioms (also called Kolmogorov's Axioms).\n\nFormally, \n\n:::{#def-prob}\n\n### Probability\nProbability is a function that maps events to a real number, obeying the axioms of probability.\n\n:::\n\nThe axioms of probability make sure that the separate events add up in terms of probability, and -- for standardization purposes -- that they add up to 1.\n\n:::{#def-}\n### Axioms of Probability\n\n1.

The states could be something like Normal/Defective, Healthy/Diseased, Republican/Democrat/Independent, etc.  The event on which one conditions could be something like a sampling from a batch of components, a test for a disease, or a question about a policy position.\n\n__Prior and Posterior Probabilities__:  Above, $P(B_1)$ is often called the prior probability, since it's the probability of $B_1$ before anything else is known.  $P(B_1|A)$ is called the posterior probability, since it's the probability after other information is taken into account.\n\n:::{#exm-bayesrule}\n\n### Bayes' Rule\n\nIn a given town, 40% of the voters are Democrat and 60% are Republican.

What is the probability that someone positively classified as being a member of a militia group is actually a militia member?\n:::\n\n\n## Independence \n\n:::{#def-}\n### Independence\nIf the occurrence or nonoccurrence of either events $A$ and $B$ have no effect on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the other, then $A$ and $B$ are independent. \n:::\n\nIf $A$ and $B$ are independent, then\n\n:::{#prop-}\n1. $P(A|B)=P(A)$\n2. $P(B|A)=P(B)$\n3. $P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$\n4. More generally than the above, $P(\\bigcap_{i=1}^k A_i) = \\prod_{i = 1}^K P(A_i)$\n:::\n\nAre mutually exclusive events independent of each other?\n\nNo. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then they cannot happen simultaneously. If we know that A occurred, then we know that B couldn't have occurred. Because of this, A and B aren't independent.\n\n**Pairwise Independence**: A set of more than two events $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k$ is pairwise independent if  $P(A_i\\cap A_j)=P(A_i)P(A_j)$, $\\forall i\\neq j$.  Note that this does __not__ necessarily imply joint independence.\n\n**Conditional Independence**: If $A$ and $B$ are independent once you know the occurrence of a third event $C$, then $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent (conditional on $C$):\n\n1. $P(A|B \\cap C)=P(A|C)$\n2. $P(B|A \\cap C)=P(B|C)$\n3. $P(A\\cap B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)$\n\n\nJust because two events are conditionally independent does not mean that they are independent. Actually it is hard to think of real-world things that are \"unconditionally\" independent. That's why it's always important to ask about a finding: What was it conditioned on?  For example, suppose that a graduate school admission decisions are done by only one professor, who picks a group of 50 bright students and flips a coin for each student to generate a class of about 25 students. Then the the probability that two students get accepted are conditionally independent, because they are determined by two separate coin tosses. However, this does not mean that their admittance is not completely independent. Knowing that student $A$ got in gives us information about whether student $B$ got in, if we think that the professor originally picked her pool of 50 students by merit. \n\nPerhaps more counter-intuitively: If two events are already independent, then it might seem that no amount of \"conditioning\" will make them dependent. But this is not always so. For example^[Example taken from Blitzstein and Hwang, Example 2.5.10], suppose I only get a call from two people, Alice and Bob. Let $A$ be the event that Alice calls, and $B$ be the event that Bob calls. Alice and Bob do not communicate, so $P(A \\mid B) = P(A).$ But now let $C$ be the event that your phone rings. For conditional independence to hold here, then $P(A \\mid C)$ must be equal to $P(A \\mid B \\cap C).$ But this is not true -- $A \\mid C$  may or may not be true, but $P(A \\mid B \\cap C)$ certainly is true. \n \n\n\n## Random Variables\n\nMost questions in the social sciences involve events, rather than numbers per se. To analyze and reason about events quantitatively, we need a way of mapping events to numbers. A random variable does exactly that.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='41_probability_cache/html/fig-rv-image_c8b8d3b63b786e3b723cc54f2739660c'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The Random Variable as a Real-Valued Function](images/rv.png){#fig-rv-image width=1070}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{#def-}\n## Random Variable\nA random variable is a measurable function $X$ that maps from the sample space $S$ to the set of real numbers $R.$ It assigns a real number to every outcome $s \\in S$. \n:::\n\n\n@fig-rv-image shows a image of the function. It might seem strange to define a random variable as a function -- which is neither random nor variable. The randomness comes from the realization of an event from the sample space $s$.\n\n\n__Randomness__  means that the outcome of some experiment is not deterministic, i.e. there is some probability ($0 < P(A) < 1$) that the event will occur.\n\nThe support of a random variable is all values for which there is a positive probability of occurrence.\n\nExample: Flip a fair coin two times.   What is the sample space? \n\nA random variable must map events to the real line. For example, let a random variable $X$ be the number of heads. The event $(H, H)$ gets mapped to 2 $X(s) = 2$, and the events $\\{(H, T), (T, H)\\}$ gets mapped to 1 $(X(s) = 1)$, the event $(T, T)$ gets mapped to 0 $(X(s) = 0)$. \n\nWhat are other possible random variables?\n\n\n## Distributions\n\nWe now have two main concepts in this section -- probability and random variables. Given a sample space $S$ and the same experiment, both probability and random variables take events as their inputs. But they output different things (probabilities measure the \"size\" of events, random variables give a number in a way that the analyst chose to define the random variable). How do the two concepts relate?\n\nThe concept of distributions is the natural bridge between these two concepts.\n\n:::{#def-}\n### Distribution of a random variable\nA distribution of a random variable is a function that specifies the probabilities of all events associated with that random variable. There are several types of distributions: A probability mass function for a discrete random variable and probability density function for a continuous random variable.\n:::\n\nNotice how the definition of distributions combines two ideas of random variables and probabilities of events. First, the distribution considers a random variable, call it $X$. $X$ can take a number of possible numeric values. \n\n\n:::{#exm-}\n\nConsider three binary outcomes, one for each patient recovering from a disease: $R_i$ denotes the event in which patient $i$ ($i = 1, 2, 3$) recovers from a disease. $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.  How would we represent the total number of people who end up recovering from the disease?\n\n:::\n\n:::{.solution}\nDefine the random variable $X$ be the total number of people (out of three) who recover from the disease. Random variables are functions, that take as an input a set of events (in the sample space $S$) and deterministically assigns them to a number of the analyst's choice.\n\nRecall that with each of these numerical values there is a class of *events*. In the previous example, \n\n- For $X = 3$ there is one outcome ($R_1, R_2, R_3$) \n- For $X = 1$ there are multiple $\\{(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2^c, R_3), \\}$\n\nNow, the thing to notice here is that each of these events naturally come with a probability associated with them. That is, $P(R_1, R_2, R_3)$ is a number from 0 to 1, as is $P(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c)$. These all have probabilities because they are in the sample space $S$. The function that tells us these probabilities that are associated with a numerical value of a random variable is called a distribution.\n\nIn other words, a random variable $X$ *induces a probability distribution* $P$ (sometimes written $P_X$ to emphasize that the probability density is about the r.v. $X$)\n\n:::\n\n### Discrete Random Variables {-}\n\nThe formal definition of a random variable is easier to given by separating out two cases: discrete random variables when the numeric summaries of the events are discrete,  and continuous random variables when they are continuous.\n\n:::{#def-}\n### Discrete Random Variable\n$X$ is a discrete random variable if it can assume only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values.
