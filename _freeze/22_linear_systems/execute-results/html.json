If you graph the two lines, you will find that they intersect at $(3,2)$.\n\n\nDoes a linear system have one, no, or multiple solutions? For a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns (i.e., two lines):\n\n- __One solution:__ The lines intersect at exactly one point.\n- __No solution:__  The lines are parallel.\n- __Infinite solutions:__ The lines coincide.\n\n\n\n\nMethods to solve linear systems:\n\n1. Substitution\n2. Elimination of variables\n3. Matrix methods\n\n:::{#exr-lineareq}\n\nProvide a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns that has\n\n1. one solution\n2. no solution\n3. infinite solutions\n:::\n\n\n## Systems of Equations as Matrices\n\nMatrices provide an easy and efficient way to represent linear systems such as\n    $$\\begin{matrix}\n        a_{11}x_1  & + & a_{12}x_2 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{1n}x_n & = & b_1\\\\\n        a_{21}x_1  & + & a_{22}x_2 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{2n}x_n & = & b_2\\\\\n        \\vdots     &   &     &   & \\vdots &   &     & \\vdots & \\\\\n        a_{m1}x_1  & + & a_{m2}x_2 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{mn}x_n & = & b_m\n        \\end{matrix}$$\n\nas $${\\bf A x = b}$$ where\n\nThe $m \\times n$ \\textbf{coefficient matrix} ${\\bf A}$ is an array of $m n$  real numbers arranged in $m$ rows by $n$ columns:\n    $${\\bf A}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n    \\vdots &  & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n    \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe unknown quantities are represented by the vector ${\\bf x}=\\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\x_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\x_n \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe right hand side of the linear system is represented by the vector ${\\bf b}=\\begin{bmatrix} b_1\\\\b_2\\\\\\vdots\\\\b_m \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n\n__Augmented Matrix__:  When we append $\\bf b$ to the coefficient matrix $\\bf A$, we get the augmented matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}=[\\bf A | b]$\n  $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n      a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} & | & b_1\\\\\n      a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} & | & b_2\\\\\n      \\vdots &  & \\ddots & \\vdots & | & \\vdots\\\\\n      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn} & | & b_m\n      \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n\n:::{#exr-augmatrix}\n\nCreate an augmented matrix that represent the following system of equations:\n\n  $$2x_1 -7x_2 + 9x_3 -4x_4 = 8$$\n\n  $$41x_2 + 9x_3 -5x_6 = 11$$\n\n  $$x_1 -15x_2 -11x_5 = 9$$\n\n:::\n\n\n            \n## Finding Solutions to Augmented Matrices and Systems of Equations\n\n\n__Row Echelon Form__: Our goal is to translate our augmented matrix or system of equations into row echelon form. This will provide us with the values of the vector __x__ which solve the system. We use the row operations to change coefficients in the lower triangle of the augmented matrix to 0.  An augmented matrix of the form\n  $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\fbox{$a'_{11}$}& a'_{12} & a'_{13}& \\cdots & a'_{1n} & | & b'_1\\\\\n      0 & \\fbox{$a'_{22}$} & a'_{23}& \\cdots & a'_{2n} & | & b'_2\\\\\n      0 & 0 & \\fbox{$a'_{33}$}& \\cdots & a'_{3n} & | & b'_3\\\\\n      0 & 0 &0 & \\ddots & \\vdots  & | & \\vdots \\\\\n      0 & 0 &0 &0 & \\fbox{$a'_{mn}$} & | & b'_m\n      \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nis said to be in row echelon form --- each row has more leading zeros than the row preceding it.\n\n__Reduced Row Echelon Form__: We can go one step further and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form. Reduced row echelon form makes the value of __x__ which solves the system very obvious. For a system of $m$ equations in $m$ unknowns, with no all-zero rows, the reduced row echelon form would be\n\n  $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\fbox{$1$}  &  0 &   0 &    0  &   0 & | & b^*_1\\\\\n      0  &  \\fbox{$1$} &   0 &    0  &   0 & | & b^*_2\\\\\n      0  &  0 &   \\fbox{$1$} &    0  &   0 & | & b^*_3\\\\\n      0  &  0 &   0 &\\ddots &   0 & | &\\vdots\\\\\n      0  &  0 &   0 &    0  &   \\fbox{$1$} & | & b^*_m\n      \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n\n__Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination__:  We can conduct elementary row operations to get our augmented matrix into row echelon or reduced row echelon form. The methods of transforming a matrix or system into row echelon and reduced row echelon form are referred to as Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination, respectively.\n        \n__Elementary Row Operations__: To do Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination, we use three basic operations to transform the augmented matrix into another augmented matrix that represents an equivalent linear system -- equivalent in the sense that the same values of $x_j$ solve both the original and transformed matrix/system:\n\n\n__Interchanging Rows__:  Suppose we have the augmented matrix \n    $${\\widehat{\\bf A}}=\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n        a_{21} & a_{22} & | & b_2 \n        \\end{bmatrix}$$\nIf we interchange the two rows, we get the augmented matrix\n    $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n        a_{21} & a_{22} & | & b_2\\\\\n        a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\n        \\end{bmatrix}$$\nwhich represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}$.\n\n__Multiplying by a Constant__: If we multiply the second row of matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}$ by a constant $c$, we get the augmented matrix\n    $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n        a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n        c a_{21} & c a_{22} & | & c b_2\n        \\end{bmatrix}$$\n        which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}$.\n\n__Adding (subtracting) Rows__:  If we add (subtract) the first row of matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}$ to the second, we obtain the augmented matrix\n    $$\\begin{bmatrix}\n        a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n        a_{11}+a_{21} & a_{12}+a_{22} & | & b_1+b_2\n        \\end{bmatrix}$$\n        which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix $\\widehat{\\bf A}$.\n\n:::{#exm-solvesys}\n\nSolve the following system of equations by using elementary row operations:\n  $$\\begin{matrix}\n      x  & - & 3y & = & -3\\\\\n      2x & + &  y & = &  8\n      \\end{matrix}$$\n\n:::\n\n\n\n            \n:::{#exr-solvesys1}\n\nPut the following system of equations into augmented matrix form.
