These data sets contained variables which correspond to tangible phenomena out in the world. While the bulk of social science research uses data of this sort, generating *fake* data can be surprisingly useful. Fake, or synthetic, data allows us to control every aspect of the **data generating process (DGP)**. By manually tweaking different parameters that govern the DGP, we can better understand how our statistical methods will perform on real data. In this chapter we will learn some of the tools in R to simulate fake data.\n\n## Generating Fake Data\n\nFirst let's load in our favorite packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_ff80c5c86212929ef6152b61bf8d4c04'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### sample()\n\nThe simplest way to generate random data in R is through the function `samples()`. The primary inputs to `sample()` are `x`, which is the set of values you want to draw from and `size`, which is the number of samples you want to draw. Let's takes a look at an example.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_112fb861902c9dbc86e537bc35269c34'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a vector of character values\nmy_animals <- c(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"fish\", \"monkey\", \"parrot\")\n\n# From the set \"my_animals\", draw 2 at random\nsample(x = my_animals, size = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"parrot\" \"cat\"   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default, `sample()` samples *without* replacement. This means that once a value from `x` is drawn, it will be ineligible to be drawn again. The following code gives us an error because `size = 100` is larger than the total number of values in `my_animals`.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_cf9f265205f037e2398e217ba5dcd934'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(x = my_animals, size = 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in sample.int(length(x), size, replace, prob): cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo fix this we need to sample *with* replacement by setting `replace = TRUE` inside `sample()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_164ea68f5f22924e5b04e96398979c47'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(x = my_animals, size = 100, replace = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  [1] \"parrot\" \"monkey\" \"cat\"    \"fish\"   \"monkey\" \"parrot\" \"parrot\" \"dog\"   \n  [9] \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"parrot\" \"cat\"    \"fish\"   \"dog\"    \"cat\"    \"cat\"   \n [17] \"monkey\" \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"dog\"    \"fish\"   \"parrot\" \"fish\"   \"fish\"  \n [25] \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"fish\"   \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"fish\"  \n [33] \"fish\"   \"parrot\" \"dog\"    \"fish\"   \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"fish\"  \n [41] \"monkey\" \"dog\"    \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"cat\"    \"fish\"   \"monkey\" \"fish\"  \n [49] \"fish\"   \"dog\"    \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"parrot\" \"monkey\" \"parrot\" \"cat\"   \n [57] \"fish\"   \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"fish\"   \"fish\"   \"monkey\" \"cat\"    \"dog\"   \n [65] \"parrot\" \"parrot\" \"monkey\" \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"cat\"   \n [73] \"dog\"    \"dog\"    \"dog\"    \"cat\"    \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"cat\"    \"dog\"   \n [81] \"monkey\" \"parrot\" \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"monkey\" \"dog\"    \"fish\"   \"fish\"  \n [89] \"cat\"    \"fish\"   \"dog\"    \"cat\"    \"fish\"   \"cat\"    \"parrot\" \"monkey\"\n [97] \"dog\"    \"monkey\" \"fish\"   \"parrot\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe decision to sample with, or without, replacement depends on the particular DGP you want to simulate. \n\nThe `sample()` function has one last option which may be useful when generating random values. If you give `prob` a vector of values, `sample()` will draw samples from `x` in proportion to the values in `prob`. Each value in `prob` corresponds to the values in `x` that shares its position in the vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_d1fd4431cb039bdc9f8f486f90f4c69e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_animals <- sample(\n  x = my_animals,\n  size = 1000,\n  replace = TRUE,\n  prob = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code above samples `my_animals` with 10% weight on `cat`, 20% weight on `dog` and `fish`, 40% weight on `monkey`, and 10% weight on `parrot`.

Sometimes you will be working with data sets that are so large that you'll want to test your code on smaller portions first. Or you may want to perform sampling on data when creating bootstrapped confidence intervals (a topic we will return to at the end of this chapter).\n\nLet's read in the \"county_elections.csv\" data once again.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_33f5894fc49724ae068009e2752419b2'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncounty_elections <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"county_elections.csv\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 3114 Columns: 27\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): state_abbrv, county\ndbl (25): countyCode, trump16, clinton16, otherpres16, romney12, obama12, ot...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDplyr contains a function called `sample_n()` which lets you easily draw a number of random rows from your data.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_575e4eef9a0ae304f5f7e0d32791e7aa'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncounty_elections |> \n  sample_n(size = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 27\n   state_abbrv county    count…¹ trump16 clint…² other…³ romne…⁴ obama12 other…⁵\n   <chr>       <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 WV          Mingo       54059    7911    1370     229    6191    2428     211\n 2 TX          Eastland    48133    6011     776     176    5444     970      81\n 3 MA          Hampshire   25015   21790   55367    5799   21480   57359    2782\n 4 ND          Cass        38017   39816   31361    9644   36855   34712    2288\n 5 KS          Barton      20009    7888    1839     542    7874    2297     170\n 6 OH          Van Wert    39161   10469    2697     604    9585    4029     252\n 7 TX          Hood        48221   21382    4008     872   18409    3843     283\n 8 IA          Benton      19011    8232    4678     934    6940    6862     221\n 9 MI          Emmet       26047   10616    6972    1214   10253    7225     231\n10 MI          Arenac      26011    4950    2384     362    4057    3669     115\n# … with 18 more variables: total_population <dbl>, cvap <dbl>,\n#   white_pct <dbl>, black_pct <dbl>, hispanic_pct <dbl>, nonwhite_pct <dbl>,\n#   foreignborn_pct <dbl>, female_pct <dbl>, age29andunder_pct <dbl>,\n#   age65andolder_pct <dbl>, median_hh_inc <dbl>, clf_unemploy_pct <dbl>,\n#   lesshs_pct <dbl>, lesscollege_pct <dbl>, lesshs_whites_pct <dbl>,\n#   lesscollege_whites_pct <dbl>, rural_pct <dbl>, ruralurban_cc <dbl>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​countyCode, ²​clinton16, ³​otherpres16, …\n# ℹ Use `colnames()` to see all variable names\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use `sample_frac()` to specify how many random rows to draw based on a proportion of total rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_a46baefada429eebc687c6e98628a648'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncounty_elections |> \n  sample_frac(size = 0.01) # Return 1% of the final data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 31 × 27\n   state_abbrv county    count…¹ trump16 clint…² other…³ romne…⁴ obama12 other…⁵\n   <chr>       <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 OH          Clinton     39027   13838    4066     771   12009    5791     344\n 2 NC          Franklin    37069   16368   12874    1126   14603   13436     350\n 3 GA          Baker       13007     775     650      15     785     794      10\n 4 TN          Hawkins     47073   16648    3507     619   14382    5088     327\n 5 ND          Steele      38091     538     361     100     498     518      26\n 6 CO          Gilpin       8047    1566    1634     376    1346    1892     100\n 7 MO          Monroe      29137    3159     853     144    2564    1398      95\n 8 VA          Bland       51021    2573     453     113    2144     735      69\n 9 GA          Ware        13299    8513    3440     231    7941    3900      98\n10 IL          Christian   17021   10543    3992     924    8885    5494     322\n# … with 21 more rows, 18 more variables: total_population <dbl>, cvap <dbl>,\n#   white_pct <dbl>, black_pct <dbl>, hispanic_pct <dbl>, nonwhite_pct <dbl>,\n#   foreignborn_pct <dbl>, female_pct <dbl>, age29andunder_pct <dbl>,\n#   age65andolder_pct <dbl>, median_hh_inc <dbl>, clf_unemploy_pct <dbl>,\n#   lesshs_pct <dbl>, lesscollege_pct <dbl>, lesshs_whites_pct <dbl>,\n#   lesscollege_whites_pct <dbl>, rural_pct <dbl>, ruralurban_cc <dbl>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​countyCode, ²​clinton16, ³​otherpres16, …\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows, and `colnames()` to see all variable names\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerforming stratified sampling is very easy using the `group_by()` function we introduced in the last chapter.

For many common distributions of data (for example the Normal distribution), the set of possible values can range from negative infinity to positive infinity! To help us with this problem, base R comes with dozens of functions for drawing samples from well-known statistical distributions. The first one we will take a look at is `rbinom()` (`r` for \"random\" and `binom` for \"binomial\").\n\n#### Binomial Distribution\n\nThe `rbinom()` function takes three inputs: `n` for the number of draws we want, `size` for the number of binomial trails, and `prob` for the probability of a \"success\". Don't worry if some of these parameters are unfamiliar, we will cover the binomial distribution in much greater detail in the Probability section of the course. The easiest introduction to the binomial distribution is to set `size = 1` and `prob = 0.5`. This simulates flipping a coin and getting either a heads, `1`, or tails, `0` with equal probability. The code below generates 100 coin flips in this way.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_38a22111bdb9941a2ef48875fcb3ca6f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  [1] 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n [38] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\n [75] 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can replicate the same data generating process using `sample()` with the following code.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-12_01a6a8610fc1acbb074c94ba13f1434c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(x = c(0, 1),\n       size = 100,\n       replace = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  [1] 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n [38] 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n [75] 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's tweak the value for `prob` and see what happens.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-13_b41138482a99a1cae1616d42e386c500'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  [1] 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n [38] 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n [75] 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow there are way more `1`'s than `0`'s!

The object `set_of_things` should be some object in R which holds many values (such as a vector, a data frame, a list, or a matrix). The `thing` object refers to each element in `set_of_things` and changes its value each time the loop goes through a single iteration. Typically you will refer to `thing` in the body of your loop, such as in the function `do_something_to()`. A loop structured like this runs until every element in `set_of_things` is iterated through.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-28_f45ae1a9bd360e5e091501210b143f97'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (thing in set_of_things) {\n  do_something_to(thing)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is very common to use loops as a way to run a set of R commands N times, where N is some integer greater than 1.

This method is more flexible than indexing with `[i]`, but can be computationally slower to run because the `holder` object is re-writen by R each time the loop iterates.\n\n## Simulations\n\nIn the final section of this chapter we will look at a few examples of simulations that have real-world applications. The basic idea behind each of these simulations is to use R's random sampling functions (such as `rnorm()` or `runif()`) *within* a loop to generate hundreds or thousands of synthetic data points. In the real world we only get one realization of our data to analyze, but common statistical techniques are based on imagining large numbers of repeated samples of data from the same population. Simulations built in R can therefore help us approximate this process.\n\n### Central Limit Theorem\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is invoked all the time in frequentist statistical methods. In lay terms, it states that if we calculate the means of many samples from a single population, the distribution of these means will be normally distributed. And this is true regardless (with exceptions) of what the distribution of the population looks like. If this sounds like magic to you, let's use a simulation to prove it.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-34_c4a4c456346edf1c2083f9558ffbff8d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sims <- 1000\nmeans <- NULL\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirst we will set the number of simulations we want to run with `n_sims <- 1000`. Generally, running more simulations will produce more accurate results, but will also take more computation time. The object `means` will be our \"holder\" object used to store the output of each loop iteration. We set its value to `NULL` initially because it starts empty.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-35_224cc45a33060b76b9dea386f264e273'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (i in 1:n_sims) {\n  sample_data <- runif(100, min = -1, max = 1)\n  means[i] <- mean(sample_data)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe loop above contains everything we need to simulate the CLT in action. By setting `for (i in 1:n_sims)` we make the loop run `n_sims` times. Within each iteration we generate a new vector of fake data called `sample_data` which contains 100 draws of a uniform distribution whose range is from -1 to 1. We then take the average value of `sample_data` with the `mean()` function and store that into the `i`th position of the `means` holder object. \n\nNow let's graph our results!\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-36_6b4888c5d424c505363b601a66d88601'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(means) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = means)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", bins = 30) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Means from Simulated Uniform Random Samples\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14_loops_simulations_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the distribution of mean values inside `means` follow the familiar bell-shaped curve of a normal distribution---despite the fact that the random samples were drawn from a uniform distribution. Amazing!\n\n### Power Analysis\n\nPower analysis is a method used to figure out how big of a sample you need before running an experiment. Smaller sample sizes make it more difficult to detect an effect of some treatment, but budget constraints often limit how large of a sample we can acquire. To perform a power analysis, you need to have an idea of the possible effect sizes of your treatment, as well as your false-negative threshold (i.e. \"if there really is an effect from the treatment, what proportion of times should my experiment detect it?\"). Statisticians have developed fancy formulas for calculating optimal sample sizes based on these inputs. But it is much easier to instead write R code which simulates running your particular experiment thousands of times. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-37_a883099c4c8d4c43f280b0d9f08e3566'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sims <- 10000\np_values <- NULL\neffect <- 0.5\nsample_size <- 50\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs in the Central Limit Theorem example, we will set `n_sims <- 10000`. Our \"holder\" object will be called `p_values` this time because that is what we will be extracting from every iteration of our loop below. Lastly we need to specify a treatment effect, `effect` and sample size for our experiment `sample_size`. The beauty of running simulations in R is that we can easily play around with different values of `effect` and `sample_size` and check out the new results.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-38_9c1554266f60d8eb8f2d50b3db5f1f1a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Setting seed so we all get the same results\nset.seed(10071992)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_sims) {\n  treated <- rnorm(sample_size / 2, mean = effect)\n  control <- rnorm(sample_size / 2, mean = 0)\n  \n  power_test <- t.test(treated, control)\n  p_values[i] <- power_test$p.value\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe loop above simulates a possible experimental design. First we create two vectors of outcomes, one for the treated group and one for our control group. The number of samples from each group is our `sample_size` divided by two, and each group is drawn from a normal distribution using `rnorm()`. However, you will notice that the `treated` group is being drawn from a normal distribution with mean equal to our specified `effect` of 0.5, whereas the `control` group is drawn from a normal distribution with `mean = 0`. In our simulated experiment, we *know* that the treatment has some effect because we generated the data to ensure it does! The normal distribution for each group has a standard deviation of one (the default in `rnorm()`). The variation in outcomes has major implications for our power analysis, but we will omit dealing with it here for simplicity.\n\nAfter generating sample outcomes for our `treated` and `control` groups, we perform a simple t-test to compare the means of each group and store the results in an object called `power_test`. Then we extract the p-value from the t-test using `$p.value` and save it into the `i`th position of the `p_values` holder object. If `power_test$p.value` is less than the conventional level of 0.05, then the simulated experiment has successfully detected the effect of the treatment. With our vector of 10,000 `p_values` in hand, we can now calculate the proportion of them which are below 0.05 using the `mean()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-39_96e70d772ad5c5570babb4e9e223a495'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(p_values < 0.05)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.4038\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like our experiment (with effect size of 0.5 and sample size of 50) was only able to detect a true effect of the treatment about 40% of the time. Ideally we would like this number to above 80% so we will probably need to recruit more participants for our experiment.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping is a technique used to calculate uncertainty regions around our statistical estimates. It approximates a confidence interval by re-sampling the underlying data (*with replacement*) thousands of times and refitting the statistical model to each of these samples. Bootstrapping is useful when calculating confidence intervals analytically is challenging or impossible (which may occur for complicated models). \n\nIn this example we will be looking at the coefficient estimate for a linear regression with median household income as the dependent variable and high school percentage as the independent variable. Recall that these variables come from the `county_elections` data.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-40_7dfef3827fdc901a5b15fbfd08c58217'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sims <- 1000\nestimates <- NULL\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will set `n_sims` to only 1,000 here because the re-sampling process can take a while. The holder `estimates` will be used to store the coefficient estimates from our linear regression.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-41_50950d408e1b08fa8ae98bcf8d51b587'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (i in 1:n_sims) {\n  county_sample <- county_elections |> \n    sample_n(size = nrow(county_elections), replace = TRUE)\n  \n  lm_model <- lm(median_hh_inc ~ lesshs_pct,\n                 data = county_sample)\n  estimates[i] <- summary(lm_model)$coef[[2]]\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first step of our simulation is to create a `county_sample` object which contains random rows from the main `county_elections` data set. Inside `sample_n()` we set `size = nrow(county_elections)` to generate a sample which has the same number of rows as the original data set. Crucially, we also set `replace = TRUE` so that it is possible to include the same row multiple times in our sampled data. If you think it seems weird to replicate rows like this, you're not alone! Yet somehow this procedure works to produce valid confidence regions around the estimated coefficient.\n\nNext we create an object `lm_model` which stores the linear regression fit on the `county_sample` data. We can extract the coefficient/slope between `lesshs_pct` and `median_hh_inc` using the verbose `summary(lm_model)$coef[[2]]` (for easier ways to extract regression coefficients see the [broom package](https://broom.tidymodels.org/)). \n\nFinally let's take a look at all these coefficient values stored in `estimates` graphically.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-42_3bc33fe2d9b0eac49238a1118e8a7be7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_plot <- tibble(estimates) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimates)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"black\",\n                 fill = \"white\",\n                 bins = 30) +\n  labs(x = \"Bootstrapped Estimates of the Regression Coefficient\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nbootstrap_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14_loops_simulations_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSometimes it is handy to save a ggplot graph in an object like we do with `bootstrap_plot`. This will allow us to add on subsequent geoms without re-writing the entire ggplot code.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-43_0eccfd9e7c791af074f38c3cafc59beb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_model <- lm(median_hh_inc ~ lesshs_pct,\n               data = county_elections)\nestimate <- summary(lm_model)$coef[[2]]\nstandard_error <- summary(lm_model)$coef[[4]]\n```\n:::\n\n\nHow do our simulated bootstrapped estimates, fit on random samples of the `county_elections` data, compare to the results of a model fit to the original data set? The code chunk above runs the linear regression model on the full `county_elections` data and saves the single estimated coefficient and standard error.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='14_loops_simulations_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-44_af7db9317bf4544b1043156ec063371c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbootstrap_plot +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = estimate,\n             color = \"maroon\", size = 1.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = estimate + standard_error * 1.96,\n             color = \"darkcyan\", size = 1.5, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = estimate - standard_error * 1.96,\n             color = \"darkcyan\", size = 1.5, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(caption = \"Full sample estimate in maroon\\n95% confidence interval in cyan\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14_loops_simulations_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdding these values to our `bootstrap_plot` using `+ geom_vline()` we can see that the bootstrapped estimates correspond neatly to the full-data model! The center of the bootstrapped distribution is right on the full-data model estimate of the coefficient, and roughly 95% of our simulated results fall within $\\pm 1.96 * \\text{standard_error}$ (the definition of a confidence interval for a linear regression coefficient).",
