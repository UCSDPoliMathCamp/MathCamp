    "markdown": "# Warmup Questions {.unnumbered}\n\nBefore our first meeting, please try solving these questions. They are a sample of the very beginning of each math section. We have provided links to the parts of the book you can read if the concepts are new to you.\n\nThe goal of this \"pre\"-math camp assignment is not to intimidate you but to set common expectations so you can make the most out of the actual Math Camp. Even if you do not understand some or all of these questions after skimming through the linked sections, your effort will pay off, and you will be better prepared for the math camp. We are also open to adjusting these expectations based on feedback (this class is for *you*), so please do not hesitate to write to the instructors for feedback.\n\n## Operations {.unnumbered}\n\n### Summation {.unnumbered}\n\nSimplify the following\n\n1. $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^3 i$\n2. $\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^3(3k + 2)$\n3. $\\sum\\limits_{i= 1}^4 (3k + i + 2)$\n\n### Products {.unnumbered}\n\n1. $\\prod\\limits_{i= 1}^3 i$\n2. $\\prod\\limits_{k=1}^3(3k + 2)$\n\n\n### Logs and exponents {.unnumbered}\n\nSimplify the following:\n\n1. $4^2$\n2. $4^2 2^3$\n3. $\\log_{10}100$\n4. $\\log_{2}4$\n5. $\\log e$, where $\\log$ is the natural log (also written as $\\ln$) -- a log with base$e$, and $e$ is Euler's constant\n6. $e^a, e^b, e^c$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ are each constants\n7. $\\log 0$\n8. $e^0$\n9. $e^1$ \n10. $\\log e^2$\n\n\n## Limits {.unnumbered}\n\nFind the limit of the following.\n\n1. $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 2} (x - 1)$ \n2. $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 2} \\frac{(x - 2) (x - 1)}{(x - 2)}$ \n3. $\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 2}\\frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x- 2}$\n\n\n## Linear Algebra {.unnumbered}\n\n### Vectors {.unnumbered}\n\nDefine the vectors \n\n$u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\2 \\\\3 \\end{pmatrix}$, \n\n$v = \\begin{pmatrix} 4\\\\5\\\\6 \\end{pmatrix}$, \n\nand the scalar $c = 2$. \n\nCalculate the following:\n\n1. $u + v$ \n2. $cv$ \n3. $u \\cdot v$\n\nAre the following sets of vectors linearly independent?\n\n1.  $u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}$, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  $u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\ 7\\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  $a = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\ -1\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $b = \\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\ -4\\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, $c = \\begin{pmatrix} 5\\\\ -10\\\\ -8 \\end{pmatrix}$ (this requires some guesswork)\n\n\n### Matrices {.unnumbered}\n\nGiven that\n\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n            7 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n            11 & 9 & 3 \\\\ \n            2 & 14 & 21 \\\\ \n            4 & 1 & 5\n        \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n\nWhat is the dimensionality of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$?\n\nWhat is the element $a_{23}$ of $\\mathbf{A}$?\n\nGiven that \n\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n    3 & 9 & 11 \\\\ \n    4 & 7 & 5 \\\\ \n    5 & 1 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n\nWhat is $\\mathbf{A}$ + $\\mathbf{B}$?\n\nGiven that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n            1 & 2 & 8 \\\\\n            3 & 9 & 11 \\\\ \n            4 & 7 & 5 \n        \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n\nWhat is $\\mathbf{A}$ + $\\mathbf{C}$?\n\nGiven that\n\n\n$$\nc = 2\n$$\n\n\nWhat is $c$ ${\\bf A}$?\n\n\n## Calculus {.unnumbered}\n\nFor each of the following functions $f(x)$, find the derivative $f'(x)$ or $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$\n\n1. $f(x)=c$ \n2. $f(x)=x$ \n3. $f(x)=x^2$ \n4. $f(x)=x^3$ \n5. $f(x)=3x^2+2x^{1/3}$ \n6. $f(x)=(x^3)(2x^4)$\n\n\n## Optimization {.unnumbered}\n\nFor each of the followng functions $f(x)$, does a maximum and minimum exist in the domain $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$?
